Comments to the Author
The paper is close to publishable, but some of the changes were implemented in such a way that they left stylistic problems and remain unclear. There are also inconsistencies in word usage and capitalization that can be easily fixed.

Sometimes "runtime" is spelled as one word, and sometimes as two "run time".
Please use "runtime" consistently.

I also see inconsistent capitalization, e,g, in Definitions 3 and 4
(please check other definitions as well)

It does not make sense to say that "the concept ... may not halt".
Try "First algorithms proposed for complementary synthesis had
major shortcomings in that they may not halt and have large overhead

 no "the" here

// it is better to avoid superlatives "much" and "very"

 are built manually and include additional functionality, such as logic for circuit test

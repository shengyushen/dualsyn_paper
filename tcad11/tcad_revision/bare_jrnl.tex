% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.
%
\documentclass[journal]{IEEEtran}
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[journal]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
   \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
   \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
\usepackage{amssymb}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/



\usepackage{algorithm}
\usepackage{algorithmic}


% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.


%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley and Jeff Goldberg.
% This package may be useful when used in conjunction with IEEEtran.cls'
% captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that submissions
% have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.3.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% For subfigure.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfigure\subfigure
% \renewcommand{\subfigure}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfigure[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat/subfig command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a
% page by themselves.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.


\usepackage[all]{xy}


% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\begin{abstract}
Complementary synthesis automatically synthesizes the decoder circuit of an encoder.
It determines the existence of the decoder by checking whether the encoder's input can be uniquely determined by its output.
However,
this algorithm will not halt if the decoder does not exist.

To solve this problem,
a novel halting algorithm is proposed.
For every path of the encoder,
this algorithm first checks whether the encoder's input can be uniquely determined by its output.
If yes,
the decoder exists;
otherwise,
this algorithm checks if this path contains loops,
which can be further unfolded to prove the nonexistence of the decoder for all those longer paths.

To illustrate its usefulness and efficiency,
this algorithm has been run on several complex encoders,
including PCI-E and Ethernet.
Experimental results indicate that
this algorithm always halts properly by distinguishing correct encoders from incorrect ones,
and it is more than three times faster than the previous work.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec_intro}
\textbf{Among the most difficult tasks in designing communication
and multimedia chips
are the design and verification of complementary circuit pairs} $(E, E^{-1})$,
in which the encoder $E$ transforms information into a format suitable for transmission and storage,
while its complementary circuit(or decoder) $E^{-1}$ recovers this information.
\textbf{To accomplish this task},
the complementary synthesis \textbf{algorithm is proposed} \cite{ShengYuShen:iccad09,ShengYuShen:tcad}
to automatically synthesize the decoder circuit of an encoder,
by checking the parameterized complementary condition(PC),
that is,
whether the encoder's input letter can be uniquely determined by its output sequence.

However,
that algorithm will not halt if $E^{-1}$ does not exist.
Another \textbf{algorithm was proposed recently} \cite{ShengYuShen:fmcad10} to solve this problem
by first constructing a list of over-approximations of PC that is similar to onion rings,
and then checking whether $E$ is in all these rings.
This algorithm is very slow and complicated.
Therefore yet another halting algorithm is proposed in this paper,
which is both faster and more straightforward.
For every path of the encoder,
this new algorithm checks two cases:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Just like the non-halting algorithm\cite{ShengYuShen:iccad09,ShengYuShen:tcad},
       checking whether the encoder's input can be uniquely determined by its output.
      If yes, the decoder exists;
 \item Otherwise,
       checking whether there are loops in the path mentioned above.
       As shown in Figure \ref{doubleloop_unfold_cmp_simple},
       the path in Figure \ref{doubleloop_unfold_cmp_simple}a) contains three sub-sequences $a$, $b$ and $c$.
       The sub-sequence $b$ is a loop
       that can be further unfolded to obtain a longer path shown in Figure \ref{doubleloop_unfold_cmp_simple}b).
       In this way,
       the nonexistence of the decoder can be proved for all those longer paths.
\end{enumerate}

\end{center}
\caption{Unfolding the loop to prove the nonexistence of the decoder for longer path}
  \label{doubleloop_unfold_cmp_simple}
\end{figure}

This new algorithm has been implemented \textbf{in} the OCaml language.
All generated SAT instances are solved with \textbf{the} Zchaff SAT solver\cite{CHAFF}.
The benchmark set includes several complex encoders from industrial projects
(e.g.,
PCI-E\cite{PCIESPEC} and Ethernet\cite{IEEE80232002}),
and their slightly modified variants without corresponding decoders.
Experimental results indicate that
this paper's algorithm always halts properly by distinguishing correct encoders from incorrect ones,
and can be three times faster than the other halting algorithm\cite{ShengYuShen:fmcad10} \textbf{proposed by us}.
All these experimental results and programs can be downloaded from \url{http://www.ssypub.org}.

\textbf{We distinguish two classes of complementary circuit pairs,
  which require different design methodologies:}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Standard datapath-intensive circuits:
  These circuits often work as digital signal processing components, such as
      Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and
      Discrete Cosine Transform(DCT).
      These circuits usually have standard and highly optimized implementations from various foundries and IP vendors,
      such as Xilinx core generator\cite{CoreGen} and Synopsys DesignWare library\cite{DesignWare}.
      \textbf{So their decoders do not need to be generated by our algorithm}.
  \item Non-standard and control-intensive circuits:
  These circuits,
  such as PCI-E\cite{PCIESPEC} and Ethernet\cite{IEEE80232002},
  are often used to handle communication protocols,
  and typically \textbf{do not} have standard implementations.
      This paper's algorithm is designed for them.
\end{enumerate}


\textbf{The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
Background material is presented in Section \ref{sec_prem}.
The algorithm is introduced in Section \ref{sec_exist},
while Section \ref{sec_rmred} describes how to remove redundant output letters to minimize the circuit area.
The experimental results are in section \ref{sec_exp} and related work is discussed in section \ref{sec_relwork}.
Finally,
Section \ref{sec_conclude} concludes this paper.}

\section{Preliminaries}\label{sec_prem}


\subsection{Propositional satisfiability}\label{subsec_SAT}
The Boolean value set is denoted as $B=\{0,1\}$.
For a Boolean formula $F$ over a variable set $V$,
the propositional satisfiability problem(abbreviated as SAT) is to find a satisfying assignment $A:V\to B$,
\textbf{so that $F$ evaluates to 1}.
If such a satisfying assignment exists, then $F$ is satisfiable;
otherwise,
it is unsatisfiable.

A computer program that decides the existence of such a satisfying assignment is called a SAT solver,
such as Zchaff\cite{CHAFF}, Grasp\cite{grasp}, Berkmin\cite{BERKMIN},
and MiniSAT\cite{EXTSAT}.
A formula to be solved by a SAT solver is also called a SAT instance.

%Normally,
%a SAT solver requires formula $F$ to be represented in the \textbf{Conjunctive Normal Form(CNF)} or the \textbf{And-Inverter Graph(AIG)} formats.
%In this paper we will only discuss the CNF format,
%in which a \textbf{formula} $F=\bigwedge_{cl\in CL}cl$ is a conjunction of its clause set $CL$,
%and a \textbf{clause} $cl=\bigvee_{l\in Lit}l$ is a disjunction of its literal set $Lit$,
%and a \textbf{literal} is a variable $v$ or its negation $\neg v$.
%A formula in the CNF format is also called a \textbf{SAT instance}.

%assume that for a particular variable $v$,
%there are two indices $0\le i\le n$ and $0\le j\le m$,
%such that $l_i\equiv v$ and $l'_j\equiv \neg v$,
%then resolution of $c$ and $c'$ is :
%\begin{displaymath}

%\end{displaymath}
%and $v$ is the pivot variable of $c$ and $c'$.

%An unsatisfiable formula often has many clause subsets that are also unsatisfiable,
%these subsets are called \textbf{unsatisfiable cores}.
%Some unsatisfiable core extraction algorithms are proposed by Goldberg et al.\cite{VERPROOF} and Zhang et al.\cite{VALIDSAT}.



\subsection{Recurrence diameter}\label{subsec_recdia}

The encoder $E$ can be modeled by a Mealy finite state machine \cite{MEALY}.

\begin{definition11}\label{MealyFSM}%\addtolength{\itemsep}{-0.5\baselineskip}
%{\setlength{\baselineskip}{0.5\baselineskip}
\textbf{Mealy finite state machine} is a 5-tuple $M=(S,s_0,I,O,T)$,
consisting of a finite state set $S$,
an initial state $s_0\in S$,
a finite set of input letters $I$,
a finite set of output letters $O$,
a transition function $T: S\times I\to S\times O$ that computes the next state and the output letter from the current state and the input letter.
%}
\end{definition11}
\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.20\textwidth]{mealy}
\end{center}
\caption{Mealy finite state machine}
  \label{mealy}
\end{figure}

As shown in Figure \ref{mealy},
as well as in the remainder of this paper,
the state is represented as a gray round corner box,
and the transition function $T$ is represented by a white rectangle.
The state, the input letter and the output letter at the $n$-th cycle are denoted as $s_n$, $i_n$ and $o_n$ respectively.
The sequence of state, input letter and output letter from the $n$-th to the $m$-th cycle are denoted as $s_n^m$, $i_n^m$ and $o_n^m$ respectively.
\textbf{A path is a state sequence $s_n^{m}$ with $\exists i_jo_j (s_{j+1},o_j)\equiv T(s_j,i_j)$ for all $n\le j< m$.
A loop is a path $s_n^{m}$ with $s_n\equiv s_m$.}
%A loop-like path is a path $s_n^{m}$ with $s_i\equiv s_j$,
%where $n\le i< j\le m$.


Kroening et al. \cite{RecDiam} defined the state variables recurrence diameter of \textbf{the Mealy machine} $M$,
denoted by $rrd(M)$,
as the longest path that starts from an initial state and does not contain a loop.

\begin{equation}\label{equ_svrd}
\begin{split}
&rrd(M)\overset{def}{=}\max\{i|\exists s_0 \dots s_i i_0 \dots i_i o_0 \dots o_i:\\
& I(s_0)\wedge \bigwedge^{i-1}_{j=0}(s_{j+1},o_j)\equiv T(s_j,i_j)\wedge\bigwedge^{i-1}_{j=0}\bigwedge^{i}_{k=j+1}s_{j}\ne s_{k}\}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

In this paper,
a similar concept: the uninitialized state variables recurrence diameter of $M$,
denoted by $uirrd(M)$,
is defined as the longest path without loop.
%}

\begin{equation}\label{equ_uisvrd}
\begin{split}
&uirrd(M)\overset{def}{=}\max\{i|\exists s_0 \dots s_i i_0 \dots i_i o_0 \dots o_i:\\
&\bigwedge^{i-1}_{j=0}(s_{j+1},o_j)\equiv T(s_j,i_j)\wedge\bigwedge^{i-1}_{j=0}\bigwedge^{i}_{k=j+1}s_{j}\ne s_{k}\}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

The only difference between these two definitions is that $uirrd$ does not consider the initial state.
These definitions are only used in proving the theorems below.
This paper's algorithm does not need to compute these diameters.

\subsection{The original non-halting algorithm to determine the existence of the decoder}\label{subsec_chkextdec}
The complementary synthesis algorithm\cite{ShengYuShen:iccad09} includes two steps:
determining the existence of the decoder and characterizing its Boolean function.
Only the first step is introduced here.

According to our previous research \cite{ShengYuShen:iccad09,ShengYuShen:tcad,ShengYuShen:fmcad10},
% and our engineering experience in designing communication chips for the TH-1A supercomputer\cite{TH1A},
many communication protocols are lossless,
that is,
every input letter can be recovered from its output sequence.

More formally,
as shown in Figure \ref{t1},
a sufficient condition for the existence of the decoder $E^{-1}$ is,
there exist three parameter values $p$, $d$ and $l$,
so that $i_n$ of the encoder $E$ can be uniquely determined by $E$'s output sequence $o_{n+d-l}^{n+d-1}$.
$d$ is the relative delay between $o_{n+d-l}^{n+d-1}$ and the input letter $i_n$,
while $l$ is the length of $o_{n+d-l}^{n+d-1}$,
and $p$ is the length of the prefix path used to rule out some unreachable states of the encoder.
Thus,
the parameterized complementary condition($PC$)\cite{ShengYuShen:iccad09} can be formally defined  as:

\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{t1}
\end{center}
\caption{The parameterized complementary condition}
  \label{t1}
\end{figure}

%However,
%the unique condition is unnecessarily restrictive,
%because it may not hold when $s_n$ is not reachable,
%even if $E$ is a correct encoder whose input can be uniquely determined by its output in its reachable state set.
%So we need to rule out unreachable states before checking the unique condition.
%
%The continuous running character of communication circuits provides us an opportunity to rule out unreachable states easily without paying the expensive cost of computing the reachable state set.
%That is to say,
%we only need to check the unique condition on the state set $RS^{\infty}$ that can be reached infinitely often from $S$.
%
%\begin{equation}
%RS^{q}\overset{def}{=} \{s_q|\bigwedge_{m=0}^{q-1}\{(s_{m+1},o_m)\equiv T(s_m,i_m)\}\}
%\end{equation}
%\begin{equation}
%RS^{>p}\overset{def}{=}\bigcup_{q>p} RS^{q}
%\end{equation}
%\begin{equation}\label{rse}
%RS^{\infty}\overset{def}{=}\lim_{p\rightarrow\infty}RS^{>p}
%\end{equation}
%
%Here,
%$RS^{q}$ is the set of states that can be reached from $S$ with exact $q$ steps.
%
%According to Equation (\ref{rse}) and Figure \ref{t1},
%$RS^{\infty}$ can be easily over-approximated by prepending a state transition sequence of length $p$ to $s_{n}$,
%which forces $s_{n}$ to be in the state set $RS^{>p}=\bigcup_{q>p} RS^{q}$.
%Obviously,
%$RS^{\infty}$ and all $RS^{>p}$ form a total order shown below,
%which means a tighter over-approximation of $RS^{\infty}$ can be obtained by increasing the length $p$ of prepended state transition sequence.
%
%\begin{displaymath}
%RS^{\infty}\subseteq\dots \subseteq RS^{>p2}\subseteq\dots \subseteq RS^{> p1}\subseteq\dots \textrm{  where } p2>p1
%\end{displaymath}

\begin{definition11}\label{def_pcc}%\addtolength{\itemsep}{-0.5\baselineskip}
%{\setlength{\baselineskip}{0.5\baselineskip}
\textbf{Parameterized complementary condition ($\boldsymbol{PC}$) :}
For encoder $E$,
$E\vDash PC(p,d,l)$ holds if
$i_n$ can be uniquely determined by $o_{n+d-l}^{n+d-1}$ in the path $s_{n-p}^{n+d-1}$.
This equals the unsatisfiability of $F_{PC}(p,d,l)$ in Equation (\ref{uniqt1}).
$E\vDash PC$ is further defined as $\exists p,d,l:E\vDash PC(p,d,l)$.
\end{definition11}

\begin{equation}\label{uniqt1}
\begin{split}
&F_{PC}(p,d,l)\overset{def}{=}\\
&\left\{
\begin{array}{cc}
&\bigwedge_{m=n-p}^{n+d-1}
\{
(s_{m+1},o_m)\equiv T(s_m,i_m)
\}
\\
\wedge&\bigwedge_{m=n-p}^{n+d-1}
\{
(s'_{m+1},o'_m)\equiv T(s'_m,i'_m)
\}
\\
\wedge&\bigwedge_{m=n+d-l}^{n+d-1}o_m\equiv o'_m \\
\wedge&i_n\ne i'_n
\end{array}
\right\}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

%This definition is the same as that of Subsection \ref{subsec_chkextdec} and paper \cite{ShengYuShen:iccad09}.

The second and third lines of Equation (\ref{uniqt1}) correspond respectively to two paths of the encoder.
The only difference between them is that a prime is appended to every variable in the third line.
The fourth line forces the output sequences of these two paths to be the same,
while the fifth line forces their input letters to be different.

This non-halting algorithm\cite{ShengYuShen:iccad09} just \textbf{iterates} through all valuations of $p$,$d$ and $l$,
from small to large,
until one valuation of $p$,$d$ and $l$ that makes Equation (\ref{uniqt1}) unsatisfiable is found.
Then the existence of the decoder is proved.
However,
if the decoder does not exist,
this algorithm will never halt.
This problem will be solved in the next section.

% \textbf{We now explain one additional challenge}.

According to Figure \ref{t1},
if  $l > d$, then,
to compute the value of  input $i_n$,
one may need to know the output $o_m$ where $m < n$.
This looks like breaking the causal relation.
\textbf{Informally,
in different states,
the encoder may produce different outputs for the same input $i_n$.
The knowledge of outputs $o_m$ where $m < n$ may be necessary to identify the state of the encoder in which the input $i_n$ has been processed.}
This problem can be further explained with the circuit in Figure \ref{mealy_add}.
Assume its transition function $T$ is:

\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{mealy_add}
\end{center}
\caption{The circuit that breaks the causal relation}
  \label{mealy_add}
\end{figure}

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{c}
s_{n+1}=i_n+s_n\\
o_{n}=i_n+s_n
\end{array}
\end{equation}

Intuitively,
this circuit adds its input to its current state,
and puts the result to its output and next state.
So,
to recover the input letter $i_{n+1}$,
the output letter $o_n$ must be subtracted from $o_{n+1}$.
In this case,
$l$ is 1,
and $d$ is 0.
This explains why $l$ can be larger than $d$.

\section{A Halting Algorithm to Determine the Existence of the Decoder}\label{sec_exist}
\subsection{Determining the nonexistence of the decoder}\label{subsec_deterNo}

$PC$ in Definition \ref{def_pcc} only defines how to determine the existence of the decoder $E^{-1}$.
But how to determine the nonexistence of $E^{-1}$ is left undefined.
So the key to a halting algorithm is to find out a necessary and sufficient condition for the nonexistence of $E^{-1}$.

According to Definition \ref{def_pcc} and Figure \ref{t1},
$E^{-1}$ exists if there is a parameter value tuple $<p,d,l>$,
such that $E\vDash PC(p,d,l)$ holds.
So,
intuitively,
$E^{-1}$ does not exist if for every parameter value tuple $<p,d,l>$,
another tuple $<p',d',l'>$ with $p'>p$,$l'>l$ and $d'>d$ can always be found,
such that $E\vDash PC(p',d',l')$ does not hold.

This case can be detected by the SAT instance in Figure \ref{fig_double_loop},
which is similar to Figure \ref{t1},
except that three new constraints are inserted to detect loops in the paths $s_{n-p}^{n+d-l}$,$s_{n+d-l+1}^n$ and $s_{n+1}^{n+d}$.
If this SAT instance is satisfiable for the parameter value $<p,d,l>$,
these three loops can be unfolded in the following way:
Assume that the length of loops in $s_{n-p}^{n+d-l}$,$s_{n+d-l+1}^n$ and $s_{n+1}^{n+d}$ are $l_1$, $l_2$ and $l_3$ respectively,
and that these loops are \textbf{unfolded $q$ times}.
Then,
the SAT instance generated \textbf{from this unfolding is shown} in Figure \ref{fig_double_loop_unfold}.
This unfolded SAT instance corresponds to $F_{LN}(p",d",l")$,
where:

\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{doubleloop}
\end{center}
\caption{The loop-like non-complementary condition}
  \label{fig_double_loop}
\end{figure}


\begin{figure}[b]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{doubleloop_unfold}
\end{center}
\caption{The loop-like non-complementary condition unfolded $q$ times}
  \label{fig_double_loop_unfold}
\end{figure}

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{ccc}
p"&=&l_1*q+(d-l+p-l_1)+l_2*q+(l-d-l_2) \\
d"&=&l_3*q+(d-l_3) \\
l"&=&l_2*q+(l-d-l_2)+l_3*q+(d-l_3)
\end{array}
\end{equation}

It is obvious that for every particular $<p,d,l>$ and $<p',d',l'>$,
there always exists a $q$,
such that $s_{n-p"}^{n+d"-l"}$,$s_{n+d"-l"+1}^n$ and $s_{n+1}^{n+d"}$ resulted from this \textbf{unfolding}
are not shorter than $s_{n-p'}^{n+d'-l'}$,$s_{n+d'-l'+1}^n$ and $s_{n+1}^{n+d'}$ respectively.
The satisfiability of this unfolded instance will be proved in Lemma \ref{lemma_unfold_longer} in next subsection.
This means for every particular $<p',d',l'>$,
we can always find another $<p",d",l">$,
such that $E\vDash PC(p",d",l")$ does not hold.
So the decoder does not exist.



According to the second and third lines of Equation (\ref{uniqt1}),
there are actually two paths,
so these loops must be detected in both of them,
i.e.,
on the product machine $M^2$ defined below:

\begin{definition11}%\addtolength{\itemsep}{-0.5\baselineskip}
%{\setlength{\baselineskip}{0.5\baselineskip}
\textbf{Product machine :}
For Mealy machine $M=(S,s_0,I,O,T)$,
its Product machine is $M^2=(S^2,s_0^2,I^2,O^2,T^2)$,
where
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $S^2=S\times S$
  \item $s_0^2=s_0\times s_0$
  \item $I^2=I\times I$
  \item $O^2=O\times O$
  \item $T^2$ is defined as $(<s_{m+1},s'_{m+1}>,<o_m,o'_m>)=T^2(<s_m,s'_m>,<i_m,i'_m>)$ with $(s_{m+1},o_m)=T(s_m,i_m)$ and $(s'_{m+1},o'_m)=T(s'_m,i'_m)$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition11}

Thus,
the loop-like non-complementary condition is formally defined below to determine the nonexistence of $E^{-1}$:

\begin{definition11}\label{def_lnc}%\addtolength{\itemsep}{-0.5\baselineskip}
%{\setlength{\baselineskip}{0.5\baselineskip}
\textbf{Loop-like Non-complementary Condition ($\boldsymbol{LN}$) :}
For encoder $E$ and its Mealy machine $M=(S,s_0,I,O,T)$,
assume its product machine is $M^2=(S^2,s_0^2,I^2,O^2,T^2)$,
then $E\vDash LN(p,d,l)$ holds if
$i_n$ cannot be uniquely determined by $o_{n+d-l}^{n+d-1}$ in the path $s_{n-p}^{n+d-1}$,
and there are loops in $(s^2)_{n-p}^{n+d-l}$,$(s^2)_{n+d-l+1}^n$ and $(s^2)_{n+1}^{n+d}$.
This equals the satisfiability of $F_{LN}(p,d,l)$ in Equation (\ref{uniqln}).
$E\vDash LN$ is further defined as $\exists p,d,l:E\vDash LN(p,d,l)$.
\end{definition11}


\begin{equation}\label{uniqln}
\begin{split}
&F_{LN}(p,d,l)\overset{def}{=}\\
&\left\{
\begin{array}{cc}
&\bigwedge_{m=n-p}^{n+d-1}
\{
(s_{m+1},o_m)\equiv T(s_m,i_m)
\}
\\
\wedge&\bigwedge_{m=n-p}^{n+d-1}
\{
(s'_{m+1},o'_m)\equiv T(s'_m,i'_m)
\}
\\
\wedge&\bigwedge_{m=n+d-l}^{n+d-1}o_m\equiv o'_m \\
\wedge& i_n\ne i'_n \\
\wedge&\bigvee_{x=n-p}^{n+d-l-1}\bigvee_{y=x+1}^{n+d-l} \{s_x\equiv s_y\wedge s'_x\equiv s'_y\} \\
\wedge&\bigvee_{x=n+d-l+1}^{n-1}\bigvee_{y=x+1}^{n} \{s_x\equiv s_y\wedge s'_x\equiv s'_y\} \\
\wedge&\bigvee_{x=n+1}^{n+d-1}\bigvee_{y=x+1}^{n+d} \{s_x\equiv s_y\wedge s'_x\equiv s'_y\}
\end{array}
\right\}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

By comparing Equations (\ref{uniqt1}) and (\ref{uniqln}),
it is obvious that \textbf{the} only difference is the last three newly inserted lines in (\ref{uniqln}),
which will be used to detect loops in the following three paths:
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{ccc}
Prefix_{p,d,l}&=&(s^2)_{n-p}^{n+d-l} \\
Left_{p,d,l}&=&(s^2)_{n+d-l+1}^n \\
Right_{p,d,l}&=&(s^2)_{n+1}^{n+d}
\end{array}
\end{equation}


The correctness of this approach will be proved in the next subsection.




\subsection{Proving correctness}

Before proving correctness of this approach,
some lemmas are needed.
\begin{figure}[b]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{doubleloop_unfold_cmp}
\caption{Correspondence between $F_{LN}(p,d,l)$ and $F_{LN}(p",d",l")$}
\label{doubleloop_unfold_cmp}
\end{figure}


\begin{lemma}[]\label{lemma_unfold_longer}
For $F_{LN}(p",d",l")$ in Figure \ref{fig_double_loop_unfold},
$E\vDash LN(p,d,l)$ implies $E\vDash LN(p",d",l")$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
The formula $F_{LN}(p",d",l")$ is:

\begin{equation}\label{equ_correspondance}
\begin{split}
&F_{LN}(p",d",l")\stackrel{def}{=}\\
&\left\{
\begin{array}{cc}
&\bigwedge_{m=n-p"}^{n+d"-1}
\{
(s_{m+1},o_m)\equiv T(s_m,i_m)
\}
\\
\wedge&\bigwedge_{m=n-p"}^{n+d"-1}
\{
(s'_{m+1},o'_m)\equiv T(s'_m,i'_m)
\}
\\
\wedge&\bigwedge_{m=n+d"-l"}^{n+d"-1}o_m\equiv o'_m \\
\wedge& i_n\ne i'_n \\
\wedge& \bigvee_{x=n-p"}^{n+d"-l"-1}\bigvee_{y=x+1}^{n+d"-l"} \{s_x\equiv s_y\wedge s'_x\equiv s'_y\} \\
\wedge& \bigvee_{x=n+d"-l"+1}^{n-1}\bigvee_{y=x+1}^{n} \{s_x\equiv s_y\wedge s'_x\equiv s'_y\} \\
\wedge& \bigvee_{x=n+1}^{n+d"-1}\bigvee_{y=x+1}^{n+d"} \{s_x\equiv s_y\wedge s'_x\equiv s'_y\}
\end{array}
\right\}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

$E\vDash LN(p,d,l)$ means that $F_{LN}(p,d,l)$ is satisfied.
Assume its satisfying assignment is $A$.
%We need to prove that $F_{LN}(p",d",l")$ is also satisfied with $A$.
The directed arcs numbered from 1 to 12 in Figure \ref{doubleloop_unfold_cmp}
show the correspondence between $F_{LN}(p,d,l)$ and $F_{LN}(p",d",l")$.

\textbf{Arcs 2 and 3} mean applying the satisfying assignment of the loop in $Right_{p,d,l}$
to the unfolded loops in $Right_{p",d",l"}$.
Arcs 1 and 4 mean applying the satisfying assignments of the two paths that \textbf{are} not in the loop,
to $Right_{p",d",l"}$.
With Arcs 1,2,3 and 4,
the path $Right_{p",d",l"}$ is satisfied.

Similarly,
the paths $Prefix_{p",d",l"}$ and $Left_{p",d",l"}$ can also be satisfied with $A$.
Thus the \textbf{second} line of Equation (\ref{equ_correspondance}) is satisfied with the assignment $A$.

Similarly,
the \textbf{third to fifth} lines of Equation (\ref{equ_correspondance}) are also satisfied with the assignment $A$.

At the same time,
there are $q$ loops in $Prefix_{p",d",l"}$, $Left_{p",d",l"}$ and $Right_{p",d",l"}$,
which will make the last three lines in Equation (\ref{equ_correspondance}) satisfied.

Thus,the satisfying assignment $A$ of $F_{LN}(p,d,l)$ can also make $F_{LN}(p",d",l")$ satisfied.
This concludes the proof.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[]\label{lemma_pc_long}
For two tuples $<p,d,l>$ and $<p',d',l'>$,
if $Prefix_{p',d',l'}$,$Left_{p',d',l'}$ and $Right_{p',d',l'}$ are \textbf{not shorter} than $Prefix_{p,d,l}$,$Left_{p,d,l}$ and $Right_{p,d,l}$ respectively,
then $E\vDash PC(p,d,l)\to E\vDash PC(p',d',l')$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
It is obvious that $F_{PC}(p,d,l)$ is a sub-formula of $F_{PC}(p',d',l')$,
\textbf{so the unsatisfiability of the former implies the unsatisfiability of the latter}.
Thus,
$E\vDash PC(p,d,l)\to E\vDash PC(p',d',l')$ holds.
\end{proof}

The following two theorems will prove that $E\vDash LN\leftrightarrow \neg \{E\vDash PC\}$.



\begin{theorem}[]\label{thm_pc_nln}
$E\vDash LN\to \neg \{E\vDash PC\}$
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
\textbf{The proof is by contradiction}.
Assume that $E\vDash LN$ and $E\vDash PC$ both hold.
This means \textbf{that} there exist $<p,d,l>$ and $<p',d',l'>$,
such that $E\vDash PC(p,d,l)$ and $E\vDash LN(p',d',l')$.

On the one hand,
$E\vDash LN(p',d',l')$ implies that there are loops in the paths $Prefix_{p',d',l'}$,$Left_{p',d',l'}$ and $Right_{p',d',l'}$.
By unfolding these loops,
another tuple $<p",d",l">$ can be found,
so that :
\begin{enumerate}
\item $Prefix_{p",d",l"}$,$Left_{p",d",l"}$ and $Right_{p",d",l"}$ are not shorter than $Prefix_{p,d,l}$,$Left_{p,d,l}$ and $Right_{p,d,l}$ respectively;
\item According to Lemma \ref{lemma_unfold_longer},
$F_{LN}(p",d",l")$ is satisfiable.
\end{enumerate}

$F_{PC}(p",d",l")$ is a sub-formula of $F_{LN}(p",d",l")$,
so $F_{PC}(p",d",l")$ is also satisfiable,
which means that $E\vDash PC(p",d",l")$ does not hold.

On the other hand,
according to Lemma \ref{lemma_pc_long},
$E\vDash PC(p",d",l")$ holds.

This contradiction concludes the proof.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[]\label{thm_nln_pc}
$E\vDash LN\gets \neg \{E\vDash PC\}$
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
\textbf{The proof is by contradiction}.
Assume that neither $E\vDash LN$ nor $E\vDash PC$ holds.
Then for every $<p,d,l>$ and $<p',d',l'>$,
$F_{PC}(p,d,l)$ is satisfiable,
while $F_{LN}(p',d',l')$ is unsatisfiable.

Thus,
assume the $uirrd(M^2)$ is the uninitialized state variables recurrence diameter of $E$'s \textbf{product machine.
Define} $<p,d,l>$ as:
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{c}
p=uirrd(M^2)*2+2 \\
d=uirrd(M^2)+1 \\
l=uirrd(M^2)*2+2
\end{array}
\end{equation}

With this definition,
it is obvious that $Prefix_{p,d,l}$,$Left_{p,d,l}$ and $Right_{p,d,l}$ are both longer than $uirrd(M^2)$.
This means that there \textbf{exist} loops in all these three paths,
which will make $F_{LN}(p,d,l)$ satisfiable.
\textbf{This contradicts the fact that} $F_{LN}(p',d',l')$ is unsatisfiable for every $<p',d',l'>$.

This contradiction concludes the proof.
\end{proof}

Theorems \ref{thm_pc_nln} and \ref{thm_nln_pc} illustrate that,
a halting algorithm can be implemented by
enumerating all combinations of $<p,d,l>$ from small to large,
and checking $E\vDash PC(p,d,l)$ and $E\vDash LN(p,d,l)$ in every iteration.
This process will eventually terminate with one and only one answer between $E\vDash PC$ and $E\vDash LN$.
The implementation of this algorithm will be presented in the next subsection.

\subsection{Algorithm implementation}\label{subsec_algoimp}

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{$check\_PCLN$}
\label{algo_pcln}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\FOR{$x=1 \to \infty$}
    \STATE{$p=2x$}
    \STATE{$d=x$}
    \STATE{$l=2x$}
      \IF{$F_{PC}(p,d,l)$ is unsatisfiable}
        \PRINT \texttt{"$E^{-1}$ exists with $<p,d,l>$"}\label{lab_pc}
        \STATE \textbf{halt};
      \ELSIF{$F_{LN}(p,d,l)$ is satisfiable}
        \PRINT \texttt{"$E^{-1}$ does not exist"}\label{lab_ln}
        \STATE \textbf{halt};
      \ENDIF
\ENDFOR
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\begin{figure}[b]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{rmred}
\end{center}
\caption{The redundant output letters}
  \label{fig_rmred}
\end{figure}

Instead of enumerating \textbf{all combinations of values for $p$, $d$ and $l$ as in earlier work} \cite{ShengYuShen:iccad09,ShengYuShen:tcad},
Line 2,3 and 4 of Algorithm \ref{algo_pcln} ensure that the lengths of $Prefix_{p,d,l}$,$Left_{p,d,l}$ and $Right_{p,d,l}$ are \textbf{all set to $x$ (Line 1)}.
\textbf{Hence,
the runtime overhead} is further reduced because many redundant combinations do not need to be tested any more.



According to Theorems \ref{thm_pc_nln} and \ref{thm_nln_pc},
Algorithm \ref{algo_pcln} will eventually terminate at line \ref{lab_pc} or \ref{lab_ln}.

\section{Removing Redundant Output Letters}\label{sec_rmred}
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{$RemoveRedundancy(p,d,l)$}
\label{algo_remove}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\FOR{$p'=p \to 0$}
  \IF{$F_{PC}(p'-1,d,l)$ is satisfiable}
    \STATE break
  \ENDIF
\ENDFOR
\FOR{$d'=d \to 0$}
  \IF{$F_{PC}(p',d'-1,l)$ is satisfiable}
    \STATE break
  \ENDIF
\ENDFOR
\FOR{$l'=1 \to l-(d-d')$}
  \IF{$F_{PC}(p',d',l')$ is unsatisfiable}
    \STATE break
  \ENDIF
\ENDFOR
\PRINT \texttt{"final result is $<p',d',l'>$"}
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

Although Algorithm \ref{algo_pcln} is sufficient to determine the existence of $E^{-1}$,
\textbf{the values found} by line \ref{lab_pc} of Algorithm \ref{algo_pcln} contain some redundancy,
which will cause unnecessarily large overheads on the circuit area and the run time of characterizing.

For example,
as shown in Figure \ref{fig_rmred},
assume that $l$ is the \textbf{smallest value} that leads to $E\vDash PC(p,d,l)$,
and $l<d$,
which means that $i_n$ is uniquely determined by some output letters $o_k$ with $k>n$.
Further assume that line \ref{lab_pc} of Algorithm \ref{algo_pcln} \textbf{proves that} $E\vDash PC(p,d,l')$.
It is obvious that $l'>d$,
which makes $i_n$ \textbf{dependent} on some redundant $o_k$ with $k\le n$.
So $o_{n+d-l'}^{n+d-l-1}$ is the sequence of redundant output letters,
which should be removed to prevent them from being instantiated as latches in circuit $E^{-1}$.
At the same time,
also according to Figure \ref{fig_rmred},
larger $p$ and $d$ lead to larger SAT instances for the characterization algorithm in the \textbf{second} step of complementary synthesis.

So,
Algorithm \ref{algo_remove} is used to minimize $<p,d,l>$ before passing it to the characterization \textbf{algorithm.}


\section{Experimental Results}\label{sec_exp}
This algorithm has been implemented \textbf{in} the OCaml language.
The generated SAT instances are solved with \textbf{the} Zchaff SAT solver\cite{CHAFF}.
All experiments are run on a PC with a 2.4GHz Intel Core 2 Q6600 processor, 8GB memory and CentOS 5.2 linux.

\end{table}

The \textbf{first and third} rows of Table \ref{tab_prodes} compare the run time of checking $E\vDash PC$ between \cite{ShengYuShen:fmcad10} and this paper.
\textbf{The fourth row shows our approach's percentage of improvements over \cite{ShengYuShen:fmcad10}}.
It is obvious that this paper's approach is much faster than that of \cite{ShengYuShen:fmcad10}.

The \textbf{second and fifth} rows compare the discovered parameter values,
and some minor differences are found on parameter value $p$.
This is caused by the \textbf{different order of checking various parameter value combinations}.

\subsection{Comparing decoder area}\label{subsec_area}

Table \ref{tab_cmparea} compares the circuit area of the decoders built manually,
and the decoders built by this paper's algorithm.
These decoders are synthesized with LSI10K technology library from Synopsys DesignCompiler.

\begin{table}[t]
\centering
\caption{Comparing decoder area}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}

this paper's algorithm   &&&&&\\ \hline
\end{tabular}\label{tab_cmparea}
\end{table}

\textbf{Table \ref{tab_cmparea} suggests that},
except for the most complex XFI, synthesis results of this paper's algorithm
are more compact than those decoders built manually. However,
this comparison is unfair because those decoders \textbf{built manually also include} additional functionality,
such as testing logic.

On the other hand,
for XFI,
the circuit area of this paper's algorithm is about 2 times larger.
This means the circuit area must be \textbf{improved in future work}.

\end{tabular}\label{tab_impdes}
\end{table}


Table \ref{tab_cmptiming} compares the \textbf{critical-path latencies} of the decoders built manually
and the decoders built by this paper's algorithm.
Their synthesis settings are the same as Subsection \ref{subsec_area}.
For all those circuits,
the \textbf{critical-path latencies} of the decoders built by this paper's algorithm are all better.

%The only exception is XFI,
%the latency of the decoder built by our algorithm is significantly larger than that of hand-written decoder.
%
%One interesting issue that is not shown in Table \ref{tab_cmptiming} is,
%all these critical paths start from registers, and end at output ports.



\subsection{Determining the nonexistence of the decoder for improperly designed encoders}\label{subsec_improp}
To further show the usefulness of this paper's algorithm,
some improperly designed encoders without corresponding decoders are needed.
These improperly designed encoders are obtained by modifying each benchmark's output statements,
so that they can explicitly output the same letter for two different input letters.
In this way,
input letter $i_n$ can never be uniquely determined by $E$'s output sequence.

The \textbf{first} row of Table \ref{tab_impdes} shows the run time of \cite{ShengYuShen:fmcad10} on checking these improperly designed encoders,
while the \textbf{second} row shows the run time of this paper's algorithm.
\textbf{The third row shows our approach's percentage of improvements over \cite{ShengYuShen:fmcad10}}.
These results indicate that this paper's algorithm always terminate correctly,
and is \textbf{much faster than previously reported methods} \cite{ShengYuShen:fmcad10}.


\section{RELATED PUBLICATIONS}\label{sec_relwork}
%\subsection{Complementary Synthesis}
%%Complementary synthesis is an emerging new research topic,
%%there are only two papers that discuss this problem.
%
%The concept of complementary synthesis was first proposed by us\cite{ShengYuShen:iccad09} in ICCAD 2009.
%Its major shortcomings are that it is incomplete,
%and its run-time overhead of building decoder is too large.
%
%The incomplete problem has been addressed by \cite{ShengYuShen:fmcad10}, while \cite{ShengYuShen:tcad} addresses the second shortcoming by simplifying the SAT instance with unsatisfiable core extraction before building decoders.

\subsection{Complementary synthesis}\label{subsec_compsyn_relat}
The concept of complementary synthesis was first \textbf{proposed in 2009}\cite{ShengYuShen:iccad09}.
Its major shortcomings \textbf{are that it may not halt},
and its \textbf{runtime} overheads \textbf{while building complementary circuit is large}.

The halting problem was handled by building a set of over-approximations that are similar to onion rings \cite{ShengYuShen:fmcad10},
while the \textbf{runtime} overhead problem was addressed by simplifying the SAT instance with unsatisfiable core extraction\cite{ShengYuShen:tcad}.

\subsection{Program inversion}\label{subsec_proinv}
According to Gulwani\cite{dim_syn},
\textbf{Program Inversion} is the problem that derives a program $P^{-1}$
that negates the computation of a given program $P$.
So the definition of \textbf{Program Inversion} is very similar to complementary synthesis.

The initial work on deriving program inversion used proof-based approaches\cite{prog_inv},
but it could only handle very small programs and very simple syntax structures.

Gl\"{u}ck et al. \cite{mtd_autoProginv} \textbf{inverted} the first-order functional programs
by eliminating nondeterminism with LR-based parsing methods.
\textbf{But the use of functional languages in that work is incompatible with our complementary synthesis}.

{Srivastava et al. \cite{prog_inv_rev} assumed that an inverse program was typically related to the original program,
so the space of possible inversions can be inferred by automatically
mining the original program for expressions, predicates, and control flow.
This algorithm inductively rules out invalid paths that \textbf{cannot} fulfill the requirement of inversion,
to narrow down the space of candidate programs until only the valid ones remain.
So it can only guarantee the existence of a solution,
but not the correctness of this solution if its assumptions do not hold.

\subsection{The completeness of bounded model checking}\label{subsec_bmc_relate}
Bounded model checking(BMC) \cite{bmc_tacas99} is a model checking technology \textbf{that considers only paths of} limited length.
So it is an incomplete algorithm.
\textbf{Many researchers have tried to find} complete approaches for BMC.

One line of research\cite{bmc_tacas99,RecDiam} tried to find out a bound $b$,
which can guarantee the correctness of a specification,
if the specification is correct on all paths that are shorter than $b$.
Line 8 of Algorithm \ref{algo_pcln} finds out the value of $p$,$d$ and $l$ that can prove the nonexistence of the decoder,
\textbf{which is similar to \cite{bmc_tacas99,RecDiam}}.

The other line of research\cite{kind_tacas99} tried \textbf{to find a bound} for induction,
such that the correctness of a specification within any bound $b$ implies the correctness on bound $b+1$.
Our algorithm proves the nonexistence of the decoder by unfolding loops.
This is similar to finding induction \textbf{patterns} in \textbf{\cite{kind_tacas99}}.

% \textbf{This paper achieves completeness without following these two approaches.
% Instead,
% it defines two complement uniqueness conditions,
% $LP$ and $LL$,
% and find out proper algorithms to check them.}

%\subsection{Temporal Logic Synthesis}
%%Automatically synthesis of program from logic specification is first identified as Church's problem in 1962\cite{LOGARTHAUTO}.
%%Some early researches \cite{SLVSQFSS,AUTOINF} solve this problem by reducing it to checking emptiness of tree automata.
%
%The temporal logic synthesis was first addressed by Clarke et al.\cite{DSGSYNTMPLG} and Manna et al. \cite{SYNTMPLGSPC}.
%But Pnueli et al. \cite{SYNRCTVMD} pointed out that the complexity of LTL synthesis is double exponent.
%%This high complexity drives researchers turning their focus to find smaller but still useful subset of temporal logic,
%%such that synthesis problem can be solved with lower complexity.
%
%One line of research \cite{CNTLSYNTMDAUTO,DTMGENGMELTL,SYNRCTVDES} focuses on the so-called generalized reactive formulas of the form:
%$(\square \lozenge p_1 \wedge \cdots \square \lozenge p_m) \to (\square \lozenge q_1 \wedge \cdots \square \lozenge q_n)$.
%Complexity of solving synthesis problem for such formula is $O(N^3)$.
%
%The other line of research focuses on finding efficient algorithm \cite{SYNCNTLBNDRPN}
%for expensive safra determination algorithm \cite{CMPLXAUTO} on an useful formula subset,
%or just avoiding it\cite{NEWALGSTRGSYN}.
%
%%Yet another approach is antichain\cite{ANTICHAIN},
%%which reduces the expensive state set computation to computation on maximal and minimal elements of lattice.
%
%Based on these research works,
%some tools\cite{ANZU} that can handle small temporal formulas have been developed.
%
%All these works assume a hostile environment,
%which seems too restrictive for many applications.
%So Fisman et al. \cite{rationalsyn_tacas10}, Chatterjee et al. \cite{assguasyn_tacas07} and Ummels et al. \cite{ralgame_istta06} proposed rational synthesis algorithm,
%which assumes that each agents act to achieve their own goals instead of failing each other.


\subsection{Protocol converter synthesis}
The protocol converter synthesis is the problem that automatically generates a translator between two different communication protocols.
This is \textbf{related to our work because both focus} on synthesizing communication circuits.

Avnit et al. \cite{converter_date08,converter_todeas09} first defined a general model for describing the different protocols.
\textbf{Then they provided} an algorithm to decide
whether there are some functionality of a protocol that \textbf{cannot} be translated into another.
Finally,
\textbf{they synthesized a translator} by computing a greatest fixed point for the update function of the buffer's control states.
Avnit et al.\cite{converter_date09} improved the algorithm mentioned above with a more efficient design space exploration algorithm.

%This paper address the first shortcoming.

\section{Conclusions}\label{sec_conclude}

This paper proposes a \textbf{faster and simpler halting} algorithm that checks whether a particular encoder has \textbf{a corresponding} decoder.
The theoretical analysis shows that this paper's approach always distinguishes correct encoders from their incorrect variants and halts properly.
Experimental results show that this paper's approach is \textbf{much faster than previous methods} \cite{ShengYuShen:fmcad10}.

\subsection{Review Number 2}
*****************

Comments to the Author

The paper is much improved.

The following corrections should however be done.

1. The phrase `state sequence' is strange. It appears to stand for what is usually called a `run' of a machine. I suggest that `run' be adopted.

Also, instead of a `loop-like path', call it `loop inclusive path'- this is more accurate and descriptive.

\smallskip
\textbf{Yes,
you are right.
Because I also use loop inclusive path as you have suggested,
I decide to use path instead of run to replace state sequence.}

\bigskip

2. Expanding of a state sequence when it has loops is usually called an `unfolding'. Again, I suggest adoption of standard terminology.

\smallskip
\textbf{Yes,
you are right.
I have changed it.}

\bigskip

3. In Definition 3, it should be Product Machine (and NOT Productive machine)- again, standard terminology.

\smallskip
\textbf{Yes,
you are right.
I have changed it.}

\bigskip

4. In reporting results in Tables II to V, comparing the time/latency/area directly is not very instructive. I suggest reporting at least percentage improvement, in addition to the raw numbers.

\smallskip
\textbf{Yes,
you are right.
I have changed the table II and V.
Please refer to Subsection \ref{subsec_prop} and \ref{subsec_improp}.}

\textbf{But on the other hand,
for the table III and IV,
the comparison is unfair because the hand built decoders include redundant logic.
We cannot say that we have achieve any improvement on them.
So we do not change this two tables.}

\bigskip

5. In referring to row numbers in the tables, please do not count the header/title line. Start counting from the first entry WITHIN the table.

\smallskip
\textbf{Yes,
you are right.
I have corrected them.
Please refer to Subsection \ref{subsec_prop} and \ref{subsec_improp}.}

\subsection{Review Number 3}
*****************

Comments to the Author
You have improved your writing but I still have a few remarks.


1) The fact that your approach is meant to design computer chips for a supercomputer
  completely clarifies your problem formulation.

  a) You build a chip for communication between two LOCAL components so one
     can avoid loss of information that occurs in long distance data transmission

  b) You do not know the "nature" of information (the supercomputer can run an arbitrary program) and so the latter cannot be compressed as for example when transmitting images.

  I think you could emphasize this fact in the very beginning of your paper.

\smallskip
\textbf{Thank you.
But I think the current statements are more appropriate.
Because this paper focuses on the halting issue,
while the lossless issue should be discussed within the framework of the original non-halting algorithm.

2)  Using  contractions in a scientific paper is not appropriate.

  (Use $<$do not$>$ instead of $<$don't$>$ , $<$cannot$>$ instead of $<$can't$>$ and so on).

\smallskip
\textbf{Thank you.Corrected.}
\smallskip

3) Still there are  typos.  For example, on the first page, in the right column, second paragraph above Figure 1:

 "Therefore this ... isn't design for them"

 'design' -> 'designed'

\smallskip
\textbf{Thank you.Corrected.}

4) I am not particularly impressed with your explanation of why to compute input $I_n$
one may need to know
  outputs $O_m$ where $m < n$ (which may look as breaking the causal relation.


 Having an example helps but it would be nice to have a simple informal explanation (like the one below).


 In different states, the encoder may produce different outputs for the same input $I_n$.
 The knowledge of outputs $O_m$, $m < n$ may be necessary to identify the STATE of the encoder  in which the input $I_n$ has been processed.

\smallskip
\textbf{Thank you.I have incorporate your suggesion into my paper.
Please refer to page 3, column 1, para 3.}

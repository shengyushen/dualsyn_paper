% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in

\documentclass[journal]{IEEEtran}
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[journal]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
   \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
   \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
\usepackage{amssymb}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/




\usepackage{algorithm}
\usepackage{algorithmic}

% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.


%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley and Jeff Goldberg.
% This package may be useful when used in conjunction with IEEEtran.cls'
% captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that submissions
% have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.3.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% For subfigure.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfigure\subfigure
% \renewcommand{\subfigure}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfigure[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat/subfig command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a
% page by themselves.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

Complementary synthesis is first proposed by us \cite{ShengYuShen:iccad09} to automatically synthesizes the decoder $E^{-1}$ of an encoder $E$.
It determines the existence of $E^{-1}$ by checking the parameterized complementary condition ($PC$),
i.e.,
whether $E$'s input can be uniquely determined by its output.
However,
this algorithm will not halt if $E^{-1}$ does not exist.
To overcome this problem,
we propose a novel halting algorithm to check $PC$ in two steps.

First,
we over-approximate $PC$ with the linear path unique condition ($LP$),
i.e.,
every linear path of $E$ longer than a particular parameter $p$ always reach the unique state set $S^U$,
in which the input letter can be uniquely determined by the output letter, current state and next state.
$LP$ can be falsified by searching for a loop-like path that does not reach $S^U$ within $E$'s recurrence diameter $rd$.
If we find such a loop,
then $E^{-1}$ does not exist.
Otherwise,
we can eventually find a $p$ to prove $LP$.

Second,
if $LP$ is proved in the first step,
we construct a list of approximations that forms an onion-ring between $PC$ and its over-approximation $LP$.
If $E$ is found to be in a certain ring but not in the next inner ring,
then $PC$ is falsified and $E^{-1}$ does not exist.
Otherwise,
the existence of $E^{-1}$ is proved.

To illustrate its usefulness,
we ran our algorithm on several complex encoders from industrial projects,
and their slightly modified variants without corresponding decoders.
Experimental results show that
our new algorithm always distinguishes correct $E$s from their incorrect variants
and halts properly.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec_intro}
We \cite{ShengYuShen:iccad09} proposed complementary synthesis to automatically synthesize an encoder $E$'s decoder $E^{-1}$ in two steps.
\textbf{First},
it determines the existence of $E^{-1}$ by checking the parameterized complementary condition($\boldsymbol{PC}$),
i.e.,
whether $E$'s input can be uniquely determined by its output on a bounded unfolding of $E$'s transition function.
\textbf{Second},
it builds $E^{-1}$ by characterizing its Boolean function with an all-solution SAT solver.

However,
the bounded nature of the first step makes it an incomplete algorithm
that will not halt if $E^{-1}$ does not exist.

To overcome this problem,
as shown in Figure \ref{f123},
we propose a novel halting algorithm to check $PC$ in two steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item First,
we over-approximate $PC$ with the linear path unique condition ($\boldsymbol{LP}$),
i.e.,
every linear path of $E$ longer than a particular parameter $p$ always reach the unique state set $S^U$,
in which the input letter can be uniquely determined by the output letter, current state and next state.
We then define the negative condition of $LP$,
the loop-like non-unique condition($\boldsymbol{LL}$).
We can falsify $LP$ and prove $LL$ by searching for a loop-like path that does not reach $S^U$ within $E$'s recurrence diameter $rd$.
If we find such a loop-like path,
then $LL$ is proved and $E^{-1}$ does not exist.
Otherwise,
a parameter $p$ can eventually be found to prove $LP$.
In this case,
we need the second step below to further check $PC$.
\item Second,
with $p$ found in the first step that prove $LP$,
we construct a list of approximations that forms an onion-ring between $PC$ and its over-approximation $LP$.
If $E$ is found to be in a certain ring but not in the next inner ring,
then $PC$ is falsified and $E^{-1}$ does not exist.
Otherwise,
the existence of $E^{-1}$ is proved.
\end{enumerate}

We have implemented our algorithm with the OCaml language,
and solved the generated SAT instances with Zchaff SAT solver\cite{CHAFF}.
The benchmark set includes several complex encoders from industrial projects,
e.g.,
PCIE and Ethernet,
and also their slightly modified variants without corresponding decoders.
Experimental results show that
our new algorithm always distinguishes correct encoders from their incorrect variants and halts properly.

All these experimental results and related programs can be downloaded from \url{http://www.ssypub.org}.

\textbf{The contribution of this paper is}:
We propose the first halting algorithm that determines the existence of an encoder's decoder.

\textbf{The remainder of this paper is organized as follows}.
Section \ref{sec_prem} presents background materials.
Section \ref{sec_t2t3} introduces how to over-approximate $PC$ with $LP$,
and how to falsify $LP$ by searching for loop-like paths.
Section \ref{sec_t1t2} introduces how to construct the onion-ring,
and how to determine whether $E$ belongs to a certain ring.
Section \ref{sec_rmred} introduces how to remove redundant output letters to minimize circuit area,
while Section \ref{sec_exp} and Section \ref{sec_relwork} presents experimental results and related works.
Section \ref{sec_conclude} concludes with a note on future work.

\section{Preliminaries}\label{sec_prem}

\subsection{Basic Notation of Propositional Satisfiability Problem}\label{subsec_SAT}
\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{center}
\end{center}
\caption{Mealy finite state machine}
  \label{mealy}
\end{figure}

For a Boolean formula $F$ over variable set $V$,
the \textbf{Propositional Satisfiability Problem}(abbreviated as \textbf{SAT}) is to find a satisfying assignment $A:V\to \{0,1\}$,
so that $F$ can be evaluated to 1.
If such a satisfying assignment exists, then $F$ is \textbf{satisfiable};
otherwise,
it is \textbf{unsatisfiable}.

A computer program that decides the existence of such a satisfying assignment is called a \textbf{SAT solver},
such as Zchaff\cite{CHAFF}, Grasp\cite{grasp}, Berkmin\cite{BERKMIN} and MiniSAT\cite{EXTSAT}.
A formula to be solved by a SAT solver is also called a \textbf{SAT instance}.

\subsection{Recurrence Diameter}

A circuit can be modeled by \textbf{Kripke structure} $M=(S,I$ $,T,A,L)$,
with a finite state set $S$,
the initial state set $I\subseteq S$,
the transition relation $T\subseteq S\times S$,
and the labeling of the states $L:S\rightarrow 2^{A}$ with atomic proposition set $A$.

Kroening et al. \cite{RecDiam} defined the \textbf{state variables recurrence diameter} with respect to $M$,
denoted by $rrd(M)$,
as the longest loop-free path in $M$ starting from an initial state.

\begin{equation}\label{equ_svrd}
\end{equation}

In this paper,
we need a similar concept: the \textbf{uninitialized state variables recurrence diameter} with respect to $M$,
denoted by $uirrd(M)$,
is the longest loop-free path in $M$.
%}

\begin{equation}\label{equ_uisvrd}
\end{equation}

The only difference between these two definitions is that
our $uirrd$ does not consider the initial state.

We present these definitions here only to facilitate our proof.
Our algorithm does not need to compute these diameters.

\subsection{The Original Algorithm to Determine the Existence of Decoder}\label{subsec_chkextdec}
The complementary synthesis algorithm\cite{ShengYuShen:iccad09} includes two steps:
determining the existence of decoder and characterizing its Boolean function.
We will only introduce the first step here.

The encoder $E$ can be modeled by a Mealy finite state machine \cite{MEALY}.

\begin{definition11}\label{MealyFSM}%\addtolength{\itemsep}{-0.5\baselineskip}
%{\setlength{\baselineskip}{0.5\baselineskip}
\textbf{Mealy finite state machine} is a 5-tuple $M=(S,s_0,I,O,T)$,
consisting of a finite state set $S$,
an initial state $s_0\in S$,
a finite set of input letters $I$,
a finite set of output letters $O$,
a transition function $T: S\times I\to S\times O$ that computes the next state and output letter from the current state and input letter.
%}
\end{definition11}

As shown in Figure \ref{mealy},
in the remainder of this paper,
we draw the state as a grey round corner box,
and draw the transition function $T$ as a white rectangle.

We denote the state, input letter and output letter at the $n$-th cycle respectively as $s_n$, $i_n$ and $o_n$.
We denote the sequence of state, input letter and output letter from the $n$-th to the $m$-th cycle respectively as $s_n^m$, $i_n^m$ and $o_n^m$.

A sufficient condition for the existence of $E^{-1}$ is the \textbf{unique condition},
i.e.,
there exists two parameters $d$ and $l$,
so that $i_n$ of $E$ can be uniquely determined by the output sequence $o_{n+d-l}^{n+d-1}$.
As shown in Figure \ref{t1t2t3}a),
$d$ is the relative delay between $o_{n+d-l}^{n+d-1}$ and the input letter $i_n$,
while $l$ is the length of $o_{n+d-l}^{n+d-1}$.

However,
the unique condition is unnecessarily restrictive,
because it may not hold when $s_n$ is not reachable,
even if $E$ is a correct encoder whose input can be uniquely determined by its output in its reachable state set.
So we need to rule out unreachable states before checking the unique condition.

The continuous running character of communication circuits provides us an opportunity to rule out unreachable states easily without paying the expensive cost of computing its reachable state set,
i.e.,
we only need to check the unique condition on the state set $RS^{\infty}$ that can be reached infinitely often from $S$.

\begin{equation}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{rse}
\end{equation}

Here,
$RS^{q}$ is the set of states that can be reached from $S$ with exact $q$ steps.

According to Equation (\ref{rse}) and Figure \ref{t1t2t3}a),
$RS^{\infty}$ can be easily over-approximated by prepending a state transition sequence of length $p$ to $s_{n}$,
which forces $s_{n}$ to be in the state set $RS^{>p}=\bigcup_{q>p} RS^{q}$.
Obviously,
$RS^{\infty}$ and all $RS^{>p}$ form a total order shown below,
which means a tighter over-approximation of $RS^{\infty}$ can be obtained by increasing the length $p$ of prepended state transition sequence.

\begin{displaymath}
RS^{\infty}\subseteq\dots \subseteq RS^{>p2}\subseteq\dots \subseteq RS^{> p1}\subseteq\dots \textrm{  where } p2>p1
\end{displaymath}

\begin{figure*}[t]
\begin{center}
\end{center}
\caption{The three unique conditions}
  \label{t1t2t3}
\end{figure*}

Thus,
as shown in Figure \ref{t1t2t3}a),
the parameterized complementary condition($PC$)\cite{ShengYuShen:iccad09} can be defined as:

\begin{definition11}\label{def_pcc}%\addtolength{\itemsep}{-0.5\baselineskip}
%{\setlength{\baselineskip}{0.5\baselineskip}
\textbf{Parameterized Complementary Condition ($\boldsymbol{PC}$) :}
For encoder $E$,
there exists three parameters $p$, $d$ and $l$,
which make $i_n$ to be uniquely determined by $o_{n+d-l}^{n+d-1}$ on $s_{n-p}^{n+d-1}$,
i.e.,
make $F_{PC}(p,d,l)$ in Equation (\ref{uniqt1}) unsatisfiable.
We denote it as $E\vDash PC(p,d,l)$,
and define $E\vDash PC$ as $\exists p,d,l:E\vDash PC(p,d,l)$.
%When $E$ is clear in the context,
%we just write $PC$ or $PC(p,d,l)$.
%Other notations are:

%1. $E\nvDash PC(p,d,l)\quad \overset{def}{=}\quad \neg \{E\vDash PC(p,d,l)\}$

%2. $E\vDash PC\quad\quad\quad\quad \overset{def}{=}\quad \exists p,d,l:E\vDash PC(p,d,l)$

%3. $E\nvDash PC\quad\quad\quad\quad \overset{def}{=}\quad \neg \{E\vDash PC\}$
%}
\end{definition11}

\begin{equation}\label{uniqt1}
\end{equation}

%This definition is the same as that of Subsection \ref{subsec_chkextdec} and paper \cite{ShengYuShen:iccad09}.

The 2nd and 3rd line of Equation (\ref{uniqt1}) correspond to two unfolded instances of $E$'s transition function.
The only difference between them is that a prime is appended to every variable in the 3rd line.
The 4th line forces the output sequences of these two unfolded instances to be the same.
The 5th line forces their input letters to be different.

\section{Over-approximating $PC$ with $LP$ and Falsifying $LP$ by Searching for Loop-like Path}\label{sec_t2t3}

\subsection{Definition of Over-approximation}\label{subsec_loopdef}

We first present some related definitions before defining the over-approximation.

\begin{definition11}\label{def_uniqstate}%\addtolength{\itemsep}{-0.5\baselineskip}
%{\setlength{\baselineskip}{0.5\baselineskip}
\textbf{Unique State Set $\boldsymbol{S^{U}}$ and Non-unique State Set $\boldsymbol{S^{N}}$:}
For a circuit $E$,
its unique state set $\boldsymbol{S^{U}}$ is the set of states $s_{n}$ that makes $i_n$ to be uniquely determined by $s_n$,$o_n$ and $s_{n+1}$,
i.e.,
makes $F^U$ in Equation (\ref{eq_uniqstate}) unsatisfiable.
The non-unique state set $S^{N}$ is the complementary set of $S^{U}$,
i.e.,
$\boldsymbol{S^{N}\overset{def}{=}S-S^{U}}$.
\end{definition11}


\begin{equation}\label{eq_uniqstate}
\end{equation}
%
%The following definitions define three types of unique conditions,
%including $PC$, $LP$ and $LL$,
%in a more formal presentation style with the symbols $\vDash$ and $\nvDash$ borrowed from model checking.

To obtain a halting algorithm,
we need to develop a negative condition for $PC$,
which can recognize all those $E\vDash\neg PC$.

Unfortunately,
it is very difficult,
if not impossible,
to develop such a condition.
So we choose to first over-approximate $PC$ with the linear path unique condition($LP$),
and then develop a negative condition for $LP$
--
the loop-like non-unique condition($LL$).
The definitions of $LP$ and $LL$ are given below,
and presented intuitively in Figure \ref{t1t2t3}b) and \ref{t1t2t3}c).

\begin{definition11}\label{def_lfuc}%\addtolength{\itemsep}{-0.5\baselineskip}
%{\setlength{\baselineskip}{0.5\baselineskip}
\textbf{Linear Path Unique Condition ($\boldsymbol{LP}$) :}
For encoder $E$,
every linear path of length $p$ always reaches the unique state set $S^{U}$,
i.e.,
makes $F_{LP}(p)$ in Equation (\ref{uniqt2}) unsatisfiable.
We denote it as $E\vDash LP(p)$,
and define $E\vDash LP$ as $\exists p:E\vDash LP(p)$.
%When $E$ is clear in the context,
%we just write $LP$ or $LP(p)$.
%Other notations are:

%1. $E\nvDash LP(p)\quad \overset{def}{=}\quad \neg \{E\vDash LP(p)\}$

%2. $E\vDash LP\quad\quad \overset{def}{=}\quad \exists p:E\vDash LP(p)$

%3. $E\nvDash LP\quad\quad \overset{def}{=}\quad \neg \{E\vDash LP\}$
%}
\end{definition11}

\begin{equation}\label{uniqt2}
\end{equation}

%\begin{figure}[t]

%\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{t2t3}
%\end{center}
%\caption{The linear path unique condition and loop-like non-unique condition}
%  \label{t2}
%\end{figure}

%The 2nd line of Equation (\ref{uniqt2}) is an unfolded instance of $E$,
%from the $(n-p)$-th to the $n$-th cycle.
%The 3rd line is another unfolded instance of $E$,
%with only the $n$-th cycle.
%The 4th line forces the current state, output letter and next state of the two unfolded instances at $n$-th cycle to be the same.
%The last line forces the $i_n$ and $i'_n$ to be different.

\begin{definition11}\label{def_llnc}%\addtolength{\itemsep}{-0.5\baselineskip}
%{\setlength{\baselineskip}{0.5\baselineskip}
\textbf{Loop-like Non-unique Condition ($\boldsymbol{LL}$) :}
For encoder $E$,
there exists a loop-like path of length $p$ that reaches the non-unique state set $S^{N}$,
i.e.,
makes $F_{LL}(p)$ in Equation (\ref{uniqt3}) satisfiable.
We denote it as $E\vDash LL(p)$,
and define $E\vDash LL$ as $\exists p:E\vDash LL(p)$.
%When $E$ is clear in the context,
%we just write $LL$ or $LL(p)$.
%Other notations are:

%1. $E\nvDash LL(p)\quad \overset{def}{=}\quad \neg \{E\vDash LL(p)\}$

%2. $E\vDash LL\quad\quad \overset{def}{=}\quad \exists p:E\vDash LL(p)$

%3. $E\nvDash LL\quad\quad \overset{def}{=}\quad \neg \{E\vDash LL\}$
%}
\end{definition11}

%\begin{equation}\label{uniqt3}
%\begin{split}
%&F_{LL}(p)\overset{def}{=}\\
%&\left\{
%\begin{array}{c}
%\bigwedge_{m=n-p}^{n}
%\{
%(s_{m+1},o_m)\equiv T(s_m,i_m)
%\}
%\\
%\wedge(s'_{n+1},o'_n)\equiv T(s'_n,i'_n)
%\\
%\wedge o_n\equiv o'_n\wedge s_n\equiv s'_n\wedge s_{n+1}\equiv s'_{n+1} \\
%\wedge i_n\ne i'_n \\
%\wedge\quad \bigvee_{m=n-p+1}^{n}\{s_m\equiv s_{n-p}\}
%\end{array}
%\right\}
%\end{split}
%\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{uniqt3}
\end{equation}

Equation (\ref{uniqt3}) is very similar to Equation (\ref{uniqt2}),
except that $\bigvee_{m=n-p+1}^{n}\{s_m\equiv s_{n-p}\}$ is inserted to find a loop-like path.

The intuition behind $LP$ and $LL$ is to check
whether $i_n$ can be uniquely determined by $s_n$,$s_{n+1}$ and $o_n$ with prepended $s_{n-p}^{n-1}$.
Here,
parameters $d$ and $l$ are removed,
which makes it easier to find the value of $p$ .

\subsection{Relationships between $PC$, $LP$ and $LL$}\label{subsec_relproof}

The relationships between $PC$, $LP$ and $LL$ are :
%\begin{enumerate}

1. $LP$ over-approximates $PC$,i.e.,$E\vDash PC\to E\vDash LP$.

2. Of $LP$ and $LL$,
there is always one and only one that holds,i.e.,$E\vDash LP\leftrightarrow E\vDash\neg LL$.

%3. At least one of $LP$ and $LL$ holds,i.e.,$E\vDash LP\vee E\vDash LL$.
%\end{enumerate}

These relationships are presented intuitively in Figure \ref{f123},
and their proofs are presented below.
Those impatient readers can skip the remainder of this subsection.

%\begin{lemma}\label{largerl}
%$E\vDash PC(p,d,l)\to E\vDash PC(p,d,l+1)$
%\end{lemma}
%\begin{IEEEproof}
%According to Equation (\ref{uniqt1}),
%it is obvious that:
%
%\begin{displaymath}
%F_{PC}(p,d,l+1)=F_{PC}(p,d,l)\wedge \quad o_{n+d-l-1}\equiv o'_{n+d-l-1}
%\end{displaymath}
%
%So the unsatisfiability of $F_{PC}(p,d,l)$ implies the unsatisfiability of $F_{PC}(p,d,l+1)$.
%Thus we have $E\vDash PC(p,d,l)\to E\vDash PC(p,d,l+1)$
%%\IEEEQED
%\end{IEEEproof}
%\smallskip
%\smallskip
%
%So while discussing $F_{PC}(p,d,l)$ and $E\vDash PC(p,d,l)$,
%we can increase $l$ to any value we like,
%which means we can always assume $l>d$.

\begin{theorem}\label{R1}
$E\vDash PC\to E\vDash LP$
\end{theorem}
\begin{IEEEproof}
Let's prove it by contradiction.
Assume that $A:V\to \{0,1\}$ is a satisfying assignment of ${F_{LP}(p)}$.

We can append a sub-formula $\bigwedge_{m=n+1}^{n+d-1}
\{
(s_{m+1},o_m)\equiv T(s_m,i_m)
\}$
to ${F_{LP}(p)}$,
and obtain:

\begin{equation}\label{uniqt2_simt1_1}
\end{equation}

In Equation (\ref{uniqt2_simt1_1}),
the newly appended sub-formula represents a state transition sequence starting from $s_{n+1}$,
so $F'_{LP}(p)$ is still satisfiable.

Similarly,
we can append another another sub-formula $\bigwedge_{m=n+1}^{n+d-1}
\{
(s'_{m+1},o'_m)\equiv T(s'_m,i'_m)
\}$ to the 3rd line of Equation (\ref{uniqt2_simt1_1}),
and obtain another satisfiable formula:

\begin{equation}\label{uniqt2_simt1_11}
\end{equation}

We can prepend a third new sub-formula $\bigwedge_{m=n-p}^{n-1}
\{
(s'_{m+1},o'_m)\equiv T(s'_m,i'_m)
\}$ to the 3rd line of Equation (\ref{uniqt2_simt1_11}),
and get a new formula :

\begin{equation}\label{uniqt2_simt1_2}
\end{equation}

Because of $s_n\equiv s'_n$ in line 4 of Equation (\ref{uniqt2_simt1_2}),
this newly prepended sub-formula represents a state transition sequence $s'^{n}_{n-p}$ that reaches $s'_n$,
which means it can be satisfied by the same satisfying assignment of $s^{n}_{n-p}$.
So $F'''_{LP}(p)$ is still satisfiable.

Assume that $A'$ is a satisfying assignment of the satisfiable formula $F'_{LP}(p)$ in Equation (\ref{uniqt2_simt1_1}).
We define a new satisfying assignment $A'''$ as:
\begin{equation}
\end{equation}

Thus,
$A'''$ is a satisfying assignment of $F'''_{LP}(p)$.

By comparing Equation (\ref{uniqt1}) with (\ref{uniqt2_simt1_2}),
it is obvious that $A'''$ is a satisfying assignment of the unsatisfiable formula ${F_{PC}(p,d,l)}$.

This contradiction concludes the proof.
%\IEEEQED
\end{IEEEproof}

\begin{theorem}\label{T2toT3}
$E\vDash LP\leftrightarrow E\vDash\neg LL$
\end{theorem}
\begin{IEEEproof}
\textbf{For the $\to$ direction},
let's prove it by contradiction.
Assume that $E\vDash LL$.
This means that there exists a loop-like path that reaches state $s_n\in S^{N}$.

Assume the length of this loop is $q$,
and the parameter of $E\vDash LP$ is $p$.
Then we can unfold this loop $[p/q]+1$ times,
to get a path that is longer than $p$,
and reaches a state $s_n\in S^{N}$.
This will lead to $E\vDash\neg LP(p)$.

This contradiction concludes the proof of the $\to$ direction.

\textbf{For the $\gets$ direction},
assume that $E\vDash\neg LP$ and $E\vDash\neg LL$,
then for all $p$,
$F_{LP}(p)$ is satisfiable.

Assume the uninitialized state variables recurrence diameter of $E$ is $uirrd$,
and let $p=uirrd+1$.
Then $F_{LP}(p)$ is satisfiable,
which means that there is a path of length $p$ that reaches a state $s_n\in S^{N}$.
Because $p$ is larger than $uirrd$,
this path must contain a loop in it,
which also makes $F_{LL}$ satisfiable.

So $E\vDash LL$ holds,
which contradicts with $E\vDash\neg LL$.

This contradiction concludes the proof of the $\gets$ direction.
%\IEEEQED
\end{IEEEproof}

\subsection{Algorithm to Check $E\vDash LP$ and $E\vDash LL$}\label{subsec_t1t2}
According to the relationships discussed in Subsection \ref{subsec_relproof},
we develop the algorithm \ref{algo_T2T3} shown below to check $E\vDash LP$ and $E\vDash LL$.
This algorithm also discovers the value of parameter $p$ if $E\vDash LP$ holds.

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{checkLPLL}
\label{algo_T2T3}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\FOR{$p=0 \to \infty$}
\IF{$F_{LP}(p)$ is unsatisfiable}
\PRINT \texttt{"$E\vDash LP(p)$"}\label{lab_t2}
\STATE \textbf{halt};
\ELSIF{$F_{LL}(p)$ is satisfiable}
\PRINT \texttt{"no $E^{-1}$ due to $E\vDash LL(p)$"}\label{lab_t3}
\STATE \textbf{halt};
\ENDIF
\ENDFOR
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

According to Theorem \ref{T2toT3},
algorithm \ref{algo_T2T3} will eventually halt at line \ref{lab_t2} or \ref{lab_t3} before $p$ reaches $E$'s uninitialized state variables recurrence diameter $uirrd$.

With algorithm \ref{algo_T2T3},
we can determine whether $E$ is an improperly designed encoder that leads to $E\vDash LL$.
\textbf{But if $E\vDash LP$, how can we determine whether $E$ is an correct encoder that leads to $E\vDash PC$}?
We will discuss this problem in the next section.

\subsection{A New Formula that Defines $LP$}
To further discuss the relationship between $PC$ and $LP$,
we need to define a new formula $\overline{F}_{LP}(p,d,l)$,
which is equal to $F_{LP}(p)$ and
similar to $F_{PC}(p,d,l)$.

\begin{equation}\label{uniqt2_simt1_3}
\end{equation}

\begin{theorem}\label{t2t2new}
$\overline{F}_{LP}(p,d,l)\leftrightarrow F_{LP}(p)$
\end{theorem}
\begin{IEEEproof}
First,
for the $\to$ direction.
It is obvious that the clause set of $\overline{F}_{LP}(p,d,l)$ is a supper set of $F_{LP}(p)$,
so the $\to$ direction is proved.

Second,
to prove the $\gets$ direction,
we list below all additional formulas in Equation (\ref{uniqt2_simt1_3}) compared to (\ref{uniqt2}),
and also our methods to satisfy them.

1. $\bigwedge_{m=n-p}^{n}\{(s'_{m+1},o'_m)\equiv T(s'_m,i'_m)\}$: This formula can be satisfied by assigning the value of $s_m$, $i_m$ and $o_m$ to $s'_m$, $i'_m$ and $o'_m$ respectively.

2. $\bigwedge_{m=n+1}^{n+d-1}\{(s_{m+1},o_m)\equiv T(s_m,i_m)\}$:
this formula represents a state transition sequence starting from $s_{n+1}$,
which are satisfiable.

3. $\bigwedge_{m=n+1}^{n+d-1}\{(s'_{m+1}$ $,o'_m)\equiv T(s'_m,i'_m)\}$:
this formula represents a state transition sequence starting from $s'_{n+1}$,
which are satisfiable.

Thus, this theorem is proved.
%\IEEEQED
\end{IEEEproof}

So,
in the remainder of this paper,
we will replace $F_{LP}(p)$ with $\overline{F}_{LP}(p,d,l)$ to define $LP$.


\section{Checking $E\vDash PC$ by Constructing Onion-Ring}\label{sec_t1t2}
\subsection{Intuitive Description}\label{subsec_intuitive}
To make it easier to follow our presentation,
we present our idea intuitively here with an example.

To facilitate our presentation,
as shown in Figure \ref{lr},
we add two new parameters $b$ and $f$ to replace $d$ and $l$.
The backward parameter $b$ refers to the distance between state $s_{n-b}$ and $s_n$.
The forward parameter $f$ refers to the distance between state $s_{n+1}$ and $s_{n+1+f}$.
The relations between $<b,f>$ and $<d,l>$ are:

\begin{equation}\label{eq_bfdl}
\end{equation}

Because Algorithm \ref{algo_T2T3} already rule out all $E$s that lead to $E\vDash LL$,
we can assume here that $E\vDash LP(p)$.
This means:

\begin{proposition}\label{p1}
$i_n$ is uniquely determined by $s_n$, $o_n$ and $s_{n+1}$.
\end{proposition}

To facilitate our presentation,
as shown in Figure \ref{lr},
we generalize Proposition \ref{p1} by:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Replacing $o_n$ with $o_{n-b}^{n+f}$,
\item Replacing $s_n$ with $s_{n-b}$,
\item Replacing $s_{n+1}$ with $s_{n+f+1}$,
\end{enumerate}
and thus obtain:
\begin{proposition}\label{p2}
$i_n$ is uniquely determined by $s_{n-b}$, $o_{n-b}^{n+f}$ and $s_{n+f+1}$.
\end{proposition}

It is obvious that Proposition \ref{p1} is a special case of Proposition \ref{p2},
with $b\equiv 0$ and $f\equiv 0$.

With this generalization,
the intuitive description of our algorithm includes the following five steps:
\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{center}
\end{center}
\caption{Forward and backward constraints}
  \label{lr}
\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
\item First,
we ignore both $s_{n-b}$ and $s_{n+f+1}$,
and test whether $i_n$ can be uniquely determined by $o_{n-b}^{n+f}$.
\textbf{If yes,
our algorithm halts with $E\vDash PC$}.

\item Otherwise,
we ignore $s_{n-b}$,
and test whether $i_n$ can be uniquely determined by $o_{n-b}^{n+f}$ and $s_{n+f+1}$.
If yes,
then $i_n$ definitely does \textbf{NOT} depend on any $o_k$ with $k<n-b$,
but it may still depend on some $o_k$ with $k>n+f$.
So we need to increase $f$ by 1 and goto step 1.

\item Otherwise,
we ignore $s_{n+f+1}$,
and test whether $i_n$ can be uniquely determined by $s_{n-b}$ and $o_{n-b}^{n+f}$.
If yes,
then $i_n$ definitely does \textbf{NOT} depend on any $o_k$ with $k>n+f$,
but it may still depend on some $o_k$ with $k<n-b$.
So we need to increase $b$ by 1 and goto step 1.

\item Otherwise,
we test whether $i_n$ can be uniquely determined by $s_{n-b}$, $o_{n-b}^{n+f}$ and $s_{n+f+1}$.
If yes,
then $i_n$ may depend on some $o_k$ with both $k<n-b$ and $k>n+f$,
we need to increase $b$ and $f$ by 1,
and goto step 1.

\item If the algorithm reaches here,
then $i_n$ can be uniquely determined by $s_{n-b'}$, $o_{n-b'}^{n+f'}$ and $s_{n+f'+1}$,
but \textbf{NOT} by $s_{n-b}$, $o_{n-b}^{n+f}$ and $s_{n+f+1}$,
where $b'\le b$ and $f'\le f$.
This means that adding even more $o_k$ into $o_{n-b}^{n+f}$ by increasing $b$ and $f$ further, will never make $PC$ holds.
\textbf{Our algorithm halts with $E\vDash\neg PC$}.
\end{enumerate}

In this algorithm,
every step with a pair of $b$ and $f$ corresponds to an onion-ring defined in subsection \ref{subsec_onionring}.
%If the algorithm halts at step 1,
%then $E^{-1}$ exists.
If it halts at step 5,
then $E$ belongs to the ring corresponds to $b'$ and $f'$,
but does not belong to the next inner ring corresponds to $b$ and $f$,
which means $E^{-1}$ does not exist.


\subsection{Constructing Onion-Ring between $PC$ and $LP$}\label{subsec_onionring}

According to Figure \ref{lr},
we define the following formulas:

$F_{unfold}$ defines two unfolded instances of transition function,
and constrains that their output sequence are equivalent,
and also constrains that their input letters are not equivalent:

\begin{equation}\label{F_unfold}
\end{equation}

$F_{backward}$ constrains that $s_{n-b}$ equals to $s'_{n-b}$:
\begin{equation}\label{F_b}
\end{equation}

$F_{forward}$ constrains that $s_{n+1+f}$ equals to $s'_{n+1+f}$:
\begin{equation}\label{F_f}
\end{equation}

%$F_{output}$ constrains that $<o_{n-b},\dots,o_{n+f}>$ equals to $<o'_{n-b},\dots,o'_{n+f}>$:
%\begin{equation}\label{F_o}
%F_{output}(p,b,f) \overset{def}{=}\bigwedge_{m=n-b}^{n+f}\{o_m\equiv o'_m\}
%\end{equation}

With these formulas,
we define another 4 new unique conditions between $PC$ and $LP$.

%\textbf{$\boldsymbol{LP\_nobf(p,b,f)}$: linear path unique condition without backward and forward constraints}:
%Every state $s_n$ reached by a linear path of length $p$
% can always make $i_n$ to be uniquely determined by $<o_{n-b},\dots,o_{n+f}>$,
%i.e.,
%make $F_{LP\_nobf}$ in Equation (\ref{t2_nobf}) unsatisfiable.

\textbf{$\boldsymbol{LP\_nobf(p,b,f)}$}:
$i_n$ can be uniquely determined by $o_{n-b}^{n+f}$,
i.e.,
make $F_{LP\_nobf}$ in Equation (\ref{t2_nobf}) unsatisfiable.

\begin{equation}\label{t2_nobf}
\end{equation}

\textbf{$\boldsymbol{LP\_f(p,b,f)}$}:
$i_n$ can be uniquely determined by $o_{n-b}^{n+f}$ and $s_{n+1+f}$,
i.e.,
make $F_{LP\_f}$ in Equation (\ref{t2_f}) unsatisfiable.
%\textbf{$\boldsymbol{LP\_f(p,b,f)}$: linear path unique condition with forward constraint only}:
%Every state $s_n$ reached by a linear path of length $p$

i.e.,

\begin{equation}\label{t2_bf}
\end{equation}

These new unique conditions,
when coupled with parameters $b$ and $f$,
will act as onion-rings between $PC$ and its over-approximation $LP$.
It is obvious that,
$LP\_bf$ is very similar to $LP$,
while $LP\_nobf$ is very similar to $PC$.

Some lemmas used to prove the correctness of the onion-ring approach are given below:

\begin{lemma}\label{lma_bfinc}
$E\vDash LP\_bf(p,b,f)\gets E\vDash LP\_bf(p,b,f+1)$
\end{lemma}
\begin{IEEEproof}
Let's prove it by contradiction.
Assume that $E\vDash\neg LP\_bf(p,b,f)$ and $E\vDash LP\_bf(p,b,f+1)$,
which means that $F_{LP\_bf}(p,b,f)$ is satisfiable while $F_{LP\_bf}(p,b,f+1)$ is unsatisfiable.

We can append a state transition to $F_{LP\_bf}(p,b,f)$ after $s_{n+f+1}$,
to get a new formula $F'_{LP\_bf}(p,b,f)$.
\begin{equation}
\end{equation}

This newly appended state transition is satisfiable,
which make $F'_{LP\_bf}$ a satisfiable formula.

Assume $A$ is a satisfying assignment of $F'_{LP\_bf}(p,b,f)$.
We define another satisfying assignment $A'$ as

\begin{equation}
\end{equation}

Obviously,
$A'$ is a satisfying assignment of unsatisfiable formula $F_{LP\_bf}(p,b,f+1)$.

This contradiction concludes the proof.
%\IEEEQED
\end{IEEEproof}

\begin{lemma}\label{lma_binc}
$E\vDash LP\_b(p,b,f)\gets E\vDash LP\_b(p+1,b+1,f)$
\end{lemma}

Its proof is similar to that of Lemma \ref{lma_bfinc}.

\begin{lemma}\label{lma_gets1}
If $E\vDash PC(p,d,l)$,
then the following Equation holds.
\begin{equation}\label{eq_gets1}
\end{equation}
\end{lemma}
\begin{IEEEproof}
%Actually we need to prove :
%\begin{equation}\label{eq_gets1_1}
%F_{LP\_bf}(p+d-l,0,d)\leftrightarrow F_{LP\_b}(p+d-l,0,d)
%\end{equation}
\textbf{For the $\gets$ direction},
according to Equation (\ref{t2_b}) and (\ref{t2_bf}),
it is obvious that the clause set of $F_{LP\_bf}$ is a super set of $F_{LP\_b}$,
which means the unsatisfiability of the latter one implies the unsatisfiability of the former one.
So the $\gets$ direction is proved.

\textbf{For the $\to$ direction},
let's prove it by contradiction.
Assume that $F_{LP\_bf}(p+d-l,0,d)$ is unsatisfiable,
and $A$ is a satisfying assignment of $F_{LP\_b}(p+d-l,0,d)$.

We define another assignment $A'$ as :
\begin{equation}
\end{equation}

Obviously,
$A$ is a satisfying assignment of Equation (\ref{uniqt1}),
which means $E\nvDash PC(p,d,l)$.
This contradiction concludes the proof of the $\to$ direction.

%\IEEEQED
\end{IEEEproof}

\begin{lemma}\label{lma_gets2}
If $E\vDash PC(p,d,l)$,
then the following Equation holds.
\begin{equation}\label{eq_gets2}
\end{equation}
\end{lemma}

Its proof is similar to that of Lemma \ref{lma_gets1}.

An important theorem that defines the onion-ring is presented and proved below:

\begin{theorem}\label{thm_onionring}
If $E\vDash PC(p,d,l)$,
then there exists a list of unique conditions with their relationship shown below:
\begin{equation}\label{eq_onionring}
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}
\begin{IEEEproof}
According to Equation (\ref{uniqt2_simt1_3}) and (\ref{t2_bf}),
the $\boldsymbol{\leftrightarrow}$ relation between the 1st and 2nd line of Equation (\ref{eq_onionring}) holds.

According to Lemma \ref{lma_bfinc},
the $\boldsymbol{\gets}$ relations between the 2nd and 6th line of Equation (\ref{eq_onionring}) holds.

According to Lemma \ref{lma_gets1},
the $\boldsymbol{\leftrightarrow}$ relation between the 6th and 7th line of Equation (\ref{eq_onionring}) holds.

According to Lemma \ref{lma_binc},
the $\boldsymbol{\gets}$ relations between the 7th and 11th line of Equation (\ref{eq_onionring}) holds.

According to Lemma \ref{lma_gets2},
the $\boldsymbol{\leftrightarrow}$ relation between the 11th and 12th line of Equation (\ref{eq_onionring}) holds.

According to Equation (\ref{uniqt1}) and (\ref{t2_nobf}),
the $\boldsymbol{\leftrightarrow}$ relations between the last two lines of Equation (\ref{eq_onionring}) holds.
%\IEEEQED
\end{IEEEproof}

In Equation (\ref{eq_onionring}),
all $\gets$ symbols form a total order,
which makes all unique conditions on right-hand side of $\vDash$s to form an onion-ring shown in Figure \ref{f123}.

\subsection{Algorithm Implementation}

With those theorems presented in Subsection \ref{subsec_onionring},
we use the following Algorithm \ref{algo_T1T2} to check $E\vDash PC$.

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{$checkPCLP(p,b,f)$}
\label{algo_T1T2}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\IF{$F_{LP\_nobf}(p,b,f)$ is unsatisfiable}
\PRINT \texttt{"$E\vDash PC(p,f,b+f+1)$"}\label{lab_t1t2_t2nobf}
\STATE \textbf{halt};
\ELSIF{$F_{LP\_f}(p,b,f)$ is unsatisfiable}
\STATE $checkPCLP(p,b,f+1)$\label{lab_t1t2_t2f}
\ELSIF{$F_{LP\_b}(p,b,f)$ is unsatisfiable}
\STATE $checkPCLP(p+1,b+1,f)$\label{lab_t1t2_t2b}
\ELSIF{$F_{LP\_bf}(p,b,f)$ is unsatisfiable}
\STATE $checkPCLP(p+1,b+1,f+1)$\label{lab_t1t2_t2bf}
\ELSE
\PRINT \texttt{"no $E^{-1}$ due to $E\vDash\neg PC$"}\label{lab_t1t2_sat}
\STATE \textbf{halt};
\ENDIF
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

Algorithm \ref{algo_T1T2} is invoked with the form $checkPCLP(p,0,0)$,
with $p$ computed by algorithm \ref{algo_T2T3}.

This algorithm just follows the onion-ring defined by Equation (\ref{eq_onionring}),
from the first line to the last line.
If $E\vDash PC$ holds,
it will eventually reach line \ref{lab_t1t2_t2nobf},
and the existence of $E^{-1}$ is proved.
Otherwise,
it will eventually reach line \ref{lab_t1t2_sat},
which means that $E$ does not belongs to the current ring,
and $PC$ is falsified.
So $E^{-1}$ does not exist.

\section{Removing Redundant Output Letters}\label{sec_rmred}
Although Algorithm \ref{algo_T2T3} and \ref{algo_T1T2} together are suffice to determine the existence of $E^{-1}$,
the parameter found by line \ref{lab_t1t2_t2nobf} of Algorithm \ref{algo_T1T2} contains some redundancy,
which will cause unnecessary large overhead of circuit area.

\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{center}
\end{center}
\caption{Redundant Output Letters}
  \label{fig_rmred}
\end{figure}

For example,
as shown in Figure \ref{fig_rmred},
assume that $l$ is the smallest parameter value that leads to $E\vDash PC(p,d,l)$,
and $l<d$,
which means that $i_n$ is uniquely determined by some output letters $o_k$ with $k>n$.

We assume again that line \ref{lab_t1t2_t2nobf} of Algorithm \ref{algo_T1T2} find out $E\vDash PC(p,d,l')$.
It is obvious that $l'>d$,
which make $i_n$ to depend on some redundant $o_k$ with $k\le n$.

So $o_{n+d-l'}^{n+d-l-1}$ is the sequence of redundant output letters,
which should be removed to prevent them from being instantiated as latches in circuit $E^{-1}$.

Algorithm 3 that removes these redundant output letters is presented below:

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{$RemoveRedundancy(p,d,l')$}
\label{algo_remove}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\FOR{$l=0 \to l'$}
\IF{$F_{PC}(p,d,l)$ is unsatisfiable}
\PRINT \texttt{"$E\vDash PC(p,d,l)$"}
\STATE \textbf{halt};
%\ELSE
%\STATE \textbf{continue};
\ENDIF
\ENDFOR
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\section{Experimental Results}\label{sec_exp}
We have implemented our algorithm in Zchaff\cite{CHAFF},
and ran it on a PC with a 2.4GHz Intel Core 2 Q6600 processor, 8GB memory and CentOS 5.2 linux.
All experimental results and programs can be downloaded from \url{http://www.ssypub.org}.
%All related programs and data files can be downloaded from \url{http://www.ssypub.org}.
\subsection{Benchmarks}
\begin{table}[t]
\centering
\caption{Information of Benchmarks}

\end{table}


Table \Rmnum{1} shows information of the following benchmarks.
%\begin{enumerate}

1. A XGXS encoder compliant to clause 48 of IEEE-802.3ae 2002 standard \cite{IEEE80232002}.

2. A XFI encoder compliant to clause 49 of the same IEEE standard.

3. A 66-bit scrambler used to ensure
that a data sequence has sufficiently many 0-1 transitions
, so that it can run through high-speed
noisy serial transmission channel.

4. A PCIE physical coding module.

5. The Ethernet module of Sun's OpenSparc T2 processor.
%\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Experimental Results on Properly Designed Encoders}
\begin{table}[b]
\centering
\caption{Experimental Results on Properly Designed Encoders}

\end{table}

The 2nd and 6th row of Table \Rmnum{2} compares the run time of checking $E\vDash PC$ between \cite{ShengYuShen:iccad09} and our approach.
The run time of our approach are much larger than \cite{ShengYuShen:iccad09}.
This is caused by checking the unique and non-unique conditions defined in Section \ref{sec_t2t3} and \ref{sec_t1t2}.

The 3rd and 7th row compare the discovered parameter values:
There are some minor differences on the parameter $p$.
This is caused by the different orders in checking various parameter combinations.

According to \cite{ShengYuShen:tcad},
$p$ is used to constrained the reachable states,
only $d$ and $l$ will affect the run time of building $E^{-1}$ and its circuit area.
To prove this,
we compare the run time of building $E^{-1}$ with all-solution SAT solver in the 4th and 8th row of Table \Rmnum{2},
and also compare the area of $E^{-1}$ in the 5th and 9th row.
These $E^{-1}$ are synthesized with DesignCompiler and LSI10 target library


It is obvious that the differences in parameter $p$ does not cause significant overhead in the run time of all-solution SAT solver and circuit area.

\begin{table}[t]
\centering
\caption{Experimental Results on Improperly Designed Encoders}

\end{table}
\subsection{Experimental Results on Improperly Designed Encoders}
To show the usefulness of our algorithm,
we need some improperly designed encoders without corresponding decoders.

We obtained these improperly designed encoders by modifying each benchmark's output statements,
such that they can explicitly output the same letter for two different input letters.
In this way,
input letter $i_n$ can never be uniquely determined by $E$'s output sequence.

The 2nd row of Table \Rmnum{3} shows the result of Algorithm 1,
while the 3rd row shows the result of algorithm 2.
The total run time is shown in the 4th row.

For XFI and scrambler,
the result of Algorithm 1 is $LL$,
which falsifies $PC$ directly.
So result of Algorithm 2 is \textbf{NA}.

It is obvious that our algorithm always terminated,
and recognized these modified incorrect encoders.

%Following are the results of checking these modified encoders:
%\begin{enumerate}

%1. XGXS:
%algorithm \ref{algo_T2T3} found out $E\vDash LP(1)$,
%but algorithm \ref{algo_T1T2} found out $E\nvDash PC$.
%The run time was 1.23 seconds.
%
%2. XFI:
%algorithm \ref{algo_T2T3} found out $E\vDash LL$.
%The run time was 44.58 seconds.
%
%3. Scrambler:
%algorithm \ref{algo_T2T3} found out $E\vDash LL$.
%The run time was 3.26 seconds.
%
%4. PCIE:
%algorithm \ref{algo_T2T3} found out $E\vDash LP(1)$,
%but algorithm \ref{algo_T1T2} found out $E\nvDash PC$.
%The run time was 1.67 seconds.
%
%5. T2:
%algorithm \ref{algo_T2T3} found out $E\vDash LP(1)$,
%but algorithm \ref{algo_T1T2} found out $E\nvDash PC$.
%The run time was 21.49 seconds.
%\end{enumerate}


\section{Related Works}\label{sec_relwork}
%\subsection{Complementary Synthesis}
%%Complementary synthesis is an emerging new research topic,
%%there are only two papers that discuss this problem.
%
%The concept of complementary synthesis was first proposed by Shen et al.\cite{ShengYuShen:iccad09} in ICCAD 2009.
%Its major shortcomings are that it is incomplete,
%and its run-time overhead of building complementary circuit is too large.
%
%The incomplete problem has been addressed by this paper, while Shen et al.\cite{ShengYuShen:tcad} addresses the second shortcoming by simplifying the SAT instance with unsatisfiable core extraction before building complementary circuits.
\subsection{Temporal Logic Synthesis}
%Automatically synthesis of program from logic specification is first identified as Church's problem in 1962\cite{LOGARTHAUTO}.
%Some early researches \cite{SLVSQFSS,AUTOINF} solve this problem by reducing it to checking emptiness of tree automata.

The temporal logic synthesis was first addressed by Clarke et.al\cite{DSGSYNTMPLG} and Manna et.al \cite{SYNTMPLGSPC}.
But Pnueli et.al \cite{SYNRCTVMD} pointed out that the complexity of LTL synthesis is double exponent.
%This high complexity drives researchers turning their focus to find smaller but still useful subset of temporal logic,
%such that synthesis problem can be solved with lower complexity.

One line of research \cite{CNTLSYNTMDAUTO,DTMGENGMELTL,SYNRCTVDES} focuses on the so-called generalized reactive formulas of the form:
$(\square \lozenge p_1 \wedge \cdots \square \lozenge p_m) \to (\square \lozenge q_1 \wedge \cdots \square \lozenge q_n)$.
Complexity of solving synthesis problem for such formula is $O(N^3)$.

The other line of research focuses on finding efficient algorithm \cite{SYNCNTLBNDRPN}
for expensive safra determination algorithm \cite{CMPLXAUTO} on an useful formula subset,
or just avoiding it\cite{NEWALGSTRGSYN}.

%Yet another approach is antichain\cite{ANTICHAIN},
%which reduces the expensive state set computation to computation on maximal and minimal elements of lattice.

Based on these research works,
some tools\cite{ANZU} that can handle small temporal formulas have been developed.

All these works assume a hostile environment,
which seems too restrictive for many applications.
So Fisman et.al \cite{rationalsyn_tacas10}, Chatterjee et.al \cite{assguasyn_tacas07} and Ummels et.al \cite{ralgame_istta06} proposed rational synthesis algorithm,
which assumes that each agents act to achieve their own goals instead of failing each other.


\subsection{Protocol Converter Synthesis}
The protocol converter synthesis was first proposed by Avnit et.al \cite{converter_date08} to automatically generate a translator between two different communication protocols.
Avnit et.al\cite{converter_date09} improves it with a more efficient design space exploration algorithm.
%The implementation of this tool is introduced in \cite{converter_tacas10}.

%This paper address the first shortcoming.

\section{Conclusions and Future Works}\label{sec_conclude}

This paper proposes the first complete approach that checks whether a particular encoder $E$ has corresponding decoder.
Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that our approach always distinguishes correct encoders from their incorrect variants and halts properly.

One future work is to develop a debugging method to find out why the $E^{-1}$ does not exist.
For the failure caused by loop-like path,
we plan to develop a debugging mechanism based on loop-like counterexample minimization \cite{ShengYuShen:charme05}.

% If you have an EPS/PDF photo (graphicx package needed) extra braces are
% needed around the contents of the optional argument to biography to prevent
% the LaTeX parser from getting confused when it sees the complicated
% \includegraphics command within an optional argument. (You could create
% your own custom macro containing the \includegraphics command to make things
% simpler here.)
%\begin{biography}[{\includegraphics[width=1in,height=1.25in,clip,keepaspectratio]{mshell}}]{Michael Shell}
% or if you just want to reserve a space for a photo:

%\begin{IEEEbiography}{Michael Shell}
%Biography text here.
%\end{IEEEbiography}

% if you will not have a photo at all:
%\begin{IEEEbiographynophoto}{John Doe}
%Biography text here.
%\end{IEEEbiographynophoto}

% insert where needed to balance the two columns on the last page with
% biographies
%\newpage

%\begin{IEEEbiographynophoto}{Jane Doe}
%Biography text here.
%\end{IEEEbiographynophoto}

% You can push biographies down or up by placing
% a \vfill before or after them. The appropriate
% use of \vfill depends on what kind of text is
% on the last page and whether or not the columns
% are being equalized.

%\vfill

% Can be used to pull up biographies so that the bottom of the last one
% is flush with the other column.

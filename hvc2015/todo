1	original compsyns all treate ambitious as invalid, and rule them all out
  but this may rule out some valid together with some invalid
	so we need an debug methods
2	resolving ambitious with counterexample minimization
	or "minimization counterexample of complementary synthesis"
3	infer the delta between two assertions, either on state machines predicates or on input pattern
4	infer the preceding pattern that resolve current ambitious


NOT used any longer

1	checking field, 
	association and distribution with formality
	inferring zero
	inferring inverse, first craig then unsat

2	original compsyn is to find the f^-1, while compsyn for fec is to find a function from a larger codomain

The Author is asked to put the article in a format compatible with
the standards of the IEEE publication department. Any deviation from the following
rules will cause inevitably some delay in publication. These rules
may change with time, and so the Author should check this file before submitting
any final manuscript. The information reported here completes and
updates the "Information for Authors" on the back cover of each issue.</p>

Submission of Final Manuscript</a></b></p>

<p class="text">
<b>Note: Only electronic submissions are acceptable.</b></p> 

<p class="text">
The following items are required for the electronic final manuscript submission:
</p>

<ul>
	<li class="text"> Hardcopy of manuscript includes all figures and tables (pdf/ps file).
        </li><li class="text"> <a href="http://tcad.polito.it/accept.html#softcopy">Softcopy of manuscript</a> (WORD, Latex).
        </li><li class="text"> <a href="http://tcad.polito.it/accept.html#figures">Camera-ready copies</a> of all figures and tables (pdf/ps file). 
	</li><li class="text"> Figure and table captions (pdf/ps file).
        </li><li class="text"> <a href="http://www.ieee.org/web/publications/rights/index.html"> Scanned Signed Copy of Copyright Transfer Form</a>. 
	(Form appears in January issues).
        </li><li class="text"> Soft copy of figures (pdf, ps, eps, tiff file).
        </li><li class="text"> [For full papers only] Brief technical biography 
	and photo (tiff file) of each Author. 

</li></ul>

<p class="text">
Please refer to the following sections for details.

</p><p class="title">
<a name="manus">
General manuscript format</a></p>

<p class="text">
The manuscript is to be printed on one side of the page
on 216x279mm  paper (US standard format) or A4 paper. 
It can be formatted either using the 
<a href="http://www.ieee.org/organizations/pubs/transactions/stylesheets.htm"> IEEE style files</a>
or doubly-spaced. </p>

<p class="text">
As mentioned in the "Information for Authors" on the
back cover of each journal issue, your manuscript will be subject to
overlength page charges if the published version exceeds nine
pages.  To estimate the amount of additional page charges you will
be responsible for (@$175 per page), roughly divide the total number
of submitted pages, including figures, by 3.5.  Detailed information
on these charges will accompany the galley proofs sent to you prior
to publication.</p>

<p class="text">
The final version of your manuscript must include the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li class="text"> An informative 50- to 200-word abstract at the head of the manuscript.
	</li><li class="text"> A double-spaced sheet listing footnotes, "affiliation of
	Author," and "acknowledgment of financial support."
	</li><li class="text"> References in a separate bibliography at the end of the
	paper, with items referred to by numerals in square brackets, e.g., [12].
	<ul>

		<li class="text">  Style for papers:       Author, first initials
		followed by last name, title, volume, inclusive page numbers, month and year.

		</li><li class="text"> Style for books:        Author, title, location and
		publisher, year, chapter or page numbers (if desired).  
		See previous issues for examples.
	</li></ul>

	</li><li class="text">  A <b>separate sheet</b> listing all figure captions in proper style
	for the typesetter, e.g., "Fig. 6.  The circuit under test."

</li></ul>

<p class="title">
<a name="figures">Illustrations/artwork</a>
</p>

<p class="text">
All original artwork for figures referred to in your manuscript is
to be <b>computer-generated</b> (laser printer quality) or drawn in India
ink on standard size paper (216x279mm or A4), and <b>separate</b> from the submitted text.
Also:
</p>

<ul>

        <li class="text"> Originals of figures and tables should be sharp, noise free,
	and of good contrast.  IEEE Transactions and Journals do not provide
	drafting or art services.

        </li><li class="text"> Line drawings in India ink on drafting film or paper are
	acceptable, as are high quality computer-generated illustrations.
	Dot matrix graphs and printouts are not acceptable.  Use standard-size
	sheets (216x279mm or A4) whenever possible for easier handling.

        </li><li class="text"> On graphs, show only the coordinate axes, or at most the
	major grid lines, to avoid a dense result after reduction.

	</li><li class="text"> Do not put boxes around figures to enclose them.

        </li><li class="text"> Lettering on figures and tables should be large enough to be
	legible after reduction to single column widths of 21 picas (about 8.9mm or 3 1/2").  
	Letter typesizes after reduction should be 6-8 pts.
	Do not use widely varying letter typesizes within a single figure;
	use the same size or similar sizes throughout the drawing.

	</li><li class="text">Try to use the same typefaces on all your figures and tables.
	Usually, one or two typefaces should suffice. It is suggested that
	you use either Times Roman or Helvetica.

        </li><li class="text"> Photographs (and Author photos) should be glossy prints not
	exceeding standard size (216x279mm or A4).

        </li><li class="text"> Number each figure and table on the bottom front and also
	indicate the Author's name.

        </li><li class="text"> Tables must be separated from the text and provided as
	camera-ready originals (just like figures).  They are not typeset.
	Use double lines at the tops of all tables.

        </li><li class="text">Figure and Table Captions List:  No captions should appear
	on the originals of figures or tables.  Provide a separate
	manuscript page typed list of all figure and table captions.

	</li><li class="text"> Corrections cannot be made on a graphic when the Author receives
	the proofs. New corrected copies must be submitted by the Author with the proofs.

</li></ul>

Submittal of electronic version</a>
</p>

<p class="text">
The IEEE electronically processes all Transactions, Journals and
Letters.  Electronic publication of papers helps speed the
production process, insures greater accuracy, and builds an
electronic abstract and index base.  
</p>

<p class="text">
While the list of processing programs acceptable to IEEE electronic
production is almost endless, there are preferred programs which,
when used, enable the preservation of the greatest amounts of
information and are most easily e-mailed due to their ASCII
structure.  TeX and LaTeX top the list of preferences.  Troff and
nroff are a close second.  
<a href="http://www.ieee.org/organizations/pubs/transactions/stylesheets.htm"> IEEE LaTeX style files</a>
and other information are available from the IEEE list server.  E-mailing a
request to help@ep.ieee.org will produce instructions on how to
obtain these items.  When sending TeX, or LaTeX, troff, etc.,
always remember to also send any macros (e.g., \defs) used to create
your manuscript.
Manuscripts developed using the Word Perfect, Mac or Word programs
are acceptable, but the mathematics will be rekeyed into a TeX
format at IEEE.  If none of these programs are available, send all
text aspects of the manuscript in ASCII format.
</p>

<p class="title">
General instructions:
</p>

<ul>
	<li class="text"> Make sure your files are self contained, i.e., that there
	are no pointers to your system set-up.
	</li><li class="text"> Check that your files are complete.  Include:  abstract,
	text, references, footnotes, biographies, and figure captions.
	</li><li class="text"> If possible, set manuscript column size to 21 picas or 89mm.
	</li><li class="text"> Include your fax number.  (Proofs will be sent by fax whenever possible.)
</li></ul>

<p class="title">
Do not:
</p>

<ul>
        <li class="text"> Import graphics files into your text file.
        </li><li class="text"> Put the files in a page layout software (Ventura,
	Quark, Pagemaker, Frame Maker).
        </li><li class="text"> Create special macros for Troff programs.  Use the
	standard codes provided by the program.
</li></ul>

<p class="title">
Galley proofs
</p>

<p class="text">
Galley proofs of your manuscript will arrive via fax or email
(unless specified otherwise) at the address of the corresponding Author
as writen on the transmittal form.
</p>

<p class="text">
<b>If galley proofs are to be sent to someone other than the
corresponding Author, that must be stated in the transmittal form </b>.
You are to address all questions regarding the publication of your paper
to the IEEE Publications Department at IEEE Publishing Services:</p>

<p class="text">
You are to return your galley proofs to the New Jersey office within
72 hours via express mail.  Therefore, if you anticipate any lengthy
absence within the next three months, it is your responsibility (as
corresponding Author) to make alternate arrangements (i.e., offering
a co-author's name as a contact for timely return of the galley
proofs).  Also, to circumvent possible typesetting errors, all
changes and corrections are to be legibly hand-printed.

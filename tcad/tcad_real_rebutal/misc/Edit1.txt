Title:   Synthesizing Complementary Circuits Automatically
Authors: ShengYu Shen,Ying Qin, JianMin Zhang,  and SiKun Li


Reviewers' and Associate Editor's Comments
==========================================


Recommendation
--------------

Accept as is


Comments to the Author
----------------------
The reviewer indicates that many of the issues have been addressed, 
and the revised version is significantly improved.  
The authors should carefully address the remaining comments, 
and go through the English writing and presentation meticulously,
 before resubmitting a final version.



Key references that must be included:

Review Number 1.
*****************

Does the revision adequately address the concerns
expressed in the original review?

Yes.


Comments to the Author
----------------------


 I am listing below some specific corrections,
 mostly dealing with spelling, grammar and style.
 In some cases, clarity is also an issue.

 While the paper should be publishable upon addressing
 those issues, the list is not exhaustive. An entire
 category of problems not addressed in it is dealing
 with tenses. When describing concepts, such as
 two-level logic synthesis, it's better to use
 the Present Tense rather than the Past Tense,
 because these concepts are still valid. But
 if you say that some concept 'was proposed earlier'
 that should be in the Past Tense.

 Finally, please do not take these corrections personally.
 In fact, I am not a native speaker of English myself :)

============================================================
Spell proper names with capital letters:
  "blue ray" -> "Blue Ray", "designware" -> "DesignWare", and so on.

  On p. 1, in
1) Standard datapath-intensive circuits
  replace "venders" with "vendors"

2) Non-standard and control-intensive circuits it
  would be good to mention some of the benchmarks
  used in Section VI, since the item 1) above mentions
  specific datapath-intensive circuits.

 Also on p. 1, in
 "More importantly, we integrate the unsatisfiable
  core extraction algorithm", replace "the" with "an"
  since no such algorithm was mentioned previously.

  On p. 2
  "Although our algorithm is based on the unsatisfiable core
   extraction algorithms, the readers do not need to dive deeply
   into the details of it."
  -->
  "Although our algorithm is based on unsatisfiable core
   extraction algorithms, the readers do not need understand
   the details."

  "The only thing that needs to be understood
   about these well-known algorithms is that"
   -> "The reader only needs to know that ..."

 "State-of-the-Art SAT solvers normally find
  only one total satisfying assignment."
 Replace "total" with "complete"
 (here an in several other places)

  On page 3.
  "An extreme example is a n-bits comparator"
  replace "n-bits" with "n-bit" (because "n-bit"
  is an adjective, not a numeral with a plural noun).

> BMC is a model checking technique
> that considers only limited length paths.
 BMC is a model-checking technique that
 considers only limited-length paths.

 "In this section, we will introduce how to check"
  replace "introduce" with "explain"

 repalce "can't" with "cannot" everywhere
 missing space: "Instead,we can only use"

 On p. 4
 "Definition 3: Parameterized Complementary
Condition:For"   -- missing space

 when referring to numbered equations, use
 the "Equation 4" style instead of "equation (4)"
  "algorithm 2" -> "Algorithm 2"
 "table IV" -> "Table IV"
 "section IV" -> "Section IV"
 (this applies to all equations, algorithms, tables, sections, etc)

 "the first line contains two unfoldings of circuit E"
 -->
 "the first line contains two unfolded instances of circuit E."

 On p. 5
 "There exist some more efficient approaches
  to enumerate satisfying assignments of SAT instance"
 --> "Other techniques to enumerate satisfying assignments
         of a SAT instance can be more efficient"

 On p.6
 "Since it is self-contradictory, formula (17) must be unsatisfiable."
 --> "This contradiction concludes the proof."

 On p. 7
 "To make A covering more satisfying assignments,"
 --> "For A to cover more satisfying assignments,"

 "XOR gates are used intensively"
 use "extensively" instead

 On p.8
-------------- replace
The third benchmark is a 66 bit scrambler used to make
a data sequence to have enough transitions between 0
and 1, so that it can run through high speed noisy serial
transmission channel.
-------------- with
The third benchmark is a 66-bit scrambler used to ensure
that a data sequence has sufficiently many transitions
between 0 and 1, so that it can run through high-speed
noisy serial transmission channel.
--------------
 I still do not understand what this means.
 Possibly replace "transitions between 0 and 1"
 with "0-1 transitions".

 "To write assertions for ruling out invalid input letters"
 should "letters" be "symbols" ? (also below)


 On p. 9
 "D. Improvement on Run Time Overhead"
  "on" -> "in"
----------- replace
Except the most complex XFI, our synthesis result
is better than that of hand written decoders. However,
this does not mean that our algorithm is better than
human designer. Actually, hand written decoders often
include some irrelevant logic, such as error detecting
and reporting function
----------- with
Except for the most complex XFI, our synthesis results
are more compact than hand-written decoders. However,
this comparison is unfair when hand-written decoders
include error-detection and reporting functions, or other
additions not required by the main functionality.

 "If it was ok, then these clauses could be removed"
 --> "When a proof is completed, those clauses can be removed."

The first class of algorithms
The second class of algorithm
The third class of algorithm
The fourth class of algorithm

Liffiton and Sakallah [45] proposed a preprocessing step to search
autarky, which was a partial assignment to the variables of a Boolean
CNF formula that satisfied every clause containing an assigned variable.

 On p. 10

"non-important variables" -> "unimportant variables"

"The classical logic synthesis worked on AND-OR network.
Its kernel was the two-level logic minimization algorithm"
 replace "kernel" with "core"

"Three most well-known"
-->  "Three best-known"

"A recent paper [35] amied to decompose"
--> "A recent paper [35] aimed to decompose"

"It is possible that, the circuit area of our generated
complementary circuits can be improved"
 remove the comma

"One possible future work is to improve"

 "to reduce the run time overhead"

This paper presents a novel two-step approach to synthesize the complementary circuit $E^{-1}$ from $E$ automatically. First, a SAT solver was used to check whether the input sequence of $E$ can be uniquely determined by its output sequence. Second, the complementary circuit $E^{-1}$ was built by characterizing its Boolean function, with an efficient all-solution SAT solver based on discovering XOR gates and extracting unsatisfiable cores.

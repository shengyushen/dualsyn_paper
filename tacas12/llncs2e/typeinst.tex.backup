\begin{abstract}
CompSyn is a tool that automatically synthesizes the decoder circuit of a particular encoder,
under some predefined assertion.
This tool has two usage modes: the synthesis mode and inferring mode.

\vspace{0.1cm}

\textbf{The synthesis mode} is used,
when the correct assertion is known,
to determine the existence of the decoder and generate it.
On the other hand,
when the correct assertion is not known,
\textbf{the inferring mode} is used to infer this assertion and generate all possible decoders.
To help the user in selecting the correct decoder,
this mode also infers each decoder's precondition formula,
which represents the set of assertions that corresponds to this decoder.

\vspace{0.1cm}

Experimental results show that
this tool can always inferring correct assertions and generate decoder circuits for several complex encoders,
including PCI-E and Ethernet.
And the human effort in specifying assertion and selecting the correct decoder can be significantly reduced.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec_intro}
One of the most difficult jobs in designing communication and multimedia chips
is to design and verify the complex complementary circuit pair $(E,E^{-1})$,
in which the encoder $E$ transforms information into a format suitable for transmission and storage,
while its complementary circuit(or decoder) $E^{-1}$ recovers this information.

In order to facilitate this job,
we propose the complementary synthesis\cite{ShengYuShen:iccad09,ShengYuShen:tcad,ShengYuShen:tcad11,ShengYuShen:iccad11} algorithm,
and develop the CompSyn tool to automatically synthesize the decoder circuit of an encoder.
This tool has two usage modes:

% \begin{enumerate}
% \item 
\textbf{The synthesis mode}:
In addition to the encoder's Verilog source code,
the user need to specify an assertion on the encoder's configuration pins,
to put the encoder into correct working states.
With this assertion,
this mode can automatically determine the existence of the decoder\cite{ShengYuShen:tcad11} and generate it\cite{ShengYuShen:tcad}.
% \item 

\textbf{The inferring mode}:
If the correct assertion is NOT known,
this mode is used to infer this assertion and generate all possible decoders\cite{ShengYuShen:iccad11}.
To help the user in selecting the correct decoder,
this mode also infers each decoder's precondition formula,
which represents the set of assertions that correspond to this decoder.
% \end{enumerate}

We have implemented our algorithm with the OCaml language,
and solved the generated SAT instances with the Minisat solver\cite{EXTSAT}.
The benchmark set includes several complex encoders from industrial projects
(e.g.,
PCI-E\cite{PCIESPEC} and Ethernet\cite{IEEE80232002}).
Experimental results show that
this tool can always infer correct assertions and generate decoders for them.
And by using the inferring mode,
the human effort in specifying assertion and selecting the correct decoder can be significantly reduced.
All experimental results and programs can be downloaded from \url{http://www.ssypub.org}.


\section{An Overview of the synthesis mode}\label{sec_syn}

The overall flow of the synthesis mode is shown in Figure \ref{fig_halting}.
These steps are connected together by the standard make tool in Linux.
\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{halting}
\caption{The flow of the synthesis mode}
\label{fig_halting}
\end{figure}

\vspace{0.2cm}
\leftline{\textbf{Constructing transition relation}}
\vspace{0.2cm}

This step takes two input,
one is the encode's Verilog source code,
and the other is the assertion on the encoder's configuration pins.
Normally,
an encoder has several modes,
each of which corresponds to a non-overlapped state set:

\begin{enumerate}
\item One of the most important modes is the working mode,
in which the encoder encodes its input letters.
So the encoder's input letter can be determined by its output sequence,
which leads to the existence of its decoder.
\item On the other hand,
the encoder still has many other non-working modes,
such as the testing and sleep mode,
in which the encoder,
respectively,
processes test commands,
or does nothing.
In these modes,
the encoder's input letter can't be determined by its output sequence,
which leads to the non-existence of its decoder.
\end{enumerate}

The assertion is used to config the encoder in correct working states.
\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{t1}
\end{center}
\caption{The parameterized complementary condition}
  \label{t1}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[b]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{doubleloop}
\end{center}
\caption{The loop-like non-complementary condition}
  \label{doubleloop}
\end{figure}

\vspace{0.2cm}
\leftline{\textbf{Unrolling transition relation and checking PC}}
\vspace{0.2cm}

$PC$ is the abbreviation of Parameterized Complementary Condition defined in \cite{ShengYuShen:iccad09},
which is used to determine the existence of the decoder.
Its meaning is intuitively shown in Figure \ref{t1}.
$T$ is the encoder's transition relation constructed in previous step,
while $i_n$ and $o_n$ are respectively the input and output letter.
$p$, $d$ and $l$ are respectively the length of the unfolded transition relation,
we also call them the size of window.
This figure,
and therefore $PC$,
means that the decoder exists for this encoder if and only if there exists $p$, $d$ and $l$,
such that the output sequence $<o_{n+d-l},\dots,o_{n+d-1}>$ can uniquely determine the input letter $i_n$.

\vspace{0.2cm}
\leftline{\textbf{Checking LN}}
\vspace{0.2cm}

In addition to the $PC$ mentioned in last subsection,
another condition,
$LN$ is defined in \cite{ShengYuShen:tcad11} to determine the non-existence of the decoder.
Its meaning is intuitively shown in Figure \ref{doubleloop}.
It means that the decoder does not exist if and only if there exists $p$, $d$ and $l$,
such that the output sequence $<o_{n+d-l},\dots,o_{n+d-1}>$ can \textbf{NOT} uniquely determine the input letter $i_n$,
and there are three loops on state sequences $<s_{n-p},\dots,s_{n+d-l}>$,$<s_{n+d-l+1},\dots,s_n>$ and $<s_{n+1},\dots,s_{n+d}>$.

If this test succeeds,
then there does not exist decoder for this encoder and its assertion.
Otherwise,
the window size will be increased and a new iteration will begin.
We have proven in \cite{ShengYuShen:tcad11} that this loop between $LN$ and $PC$ will eventually terminate.

\vspace{0.2cm}
\leftline{\textbf{Characterizing the Boolean function of the decoder}}
\vspace{0.2cm}

If the $PC$ test succeeds,
then there exist a function that map the output sequence $<o_{n+d-l},\dots,o_{n+d-1}>$ back to the input letter $i_n$.
This function can be characterized from the Boolean relation shown in Figure \ref{t1}.

Currently,
we are using the ALLSAT algorithm proposed in \cite{ShengYuShen:tcad} to characterize this function.
Recently,
Liu et al.\cite{Roland:iccad11} proposes a much faster algorithm based on Craig interpolant\cite{Craig} to characterize this function,
and the timing and area of the decoder generated by it is comparable to our ALLSAT algorithm.



\section{An Overview of the inferring mode}\label{sec_infer}
The overall flow of the synthesis mode is shown in Figure \ref{fig_infer}.
It is similar to Figure \ref{fig_halting},
with some new steps in gray color.
The user does not need to specify the assertion any more.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{infer}
\caption{The flow of the inferring mode}
\label{fig_infer}
\end{figure}

\vspace{0.2cm}
\leftline{\textbf{Ruling out invalid configuration values}}
\vspace{0.2cm}

If the $LN$ test succeeds,
an invalid configuration value that leads to the non-existence of the decoder can be obtained from the satisfying assignment returned from the SAT solver.
We can simply rule out this invalid configuration value and return to the previous step to test $LN$ again.
But to reduce the runtime overhead,
we propose an algorithm in \cite{ShengYuShen:iccad11} to enlarge this value to a larger set of invalid configuration value with Craig interpolant\cite{Craig}.

The inner loop between this step and Checking $LN$ step will not terminate until no more invalid configuration values exist.
Then the window size is increased to test $PC$ again.

We have proven in \cite{ShengYuShen:iccad11} that the outer loop between $LN$ and $PC$ will eventually terminate.
Assume that the set of all configuration values ruled out is $NA$,
then the final inferred assertion is $\wedge_{na\in NA}\neg na$.

\vspace{0.2cm}
\leftline{\textbf{Discovering all decoders' Boolean relations}}
\vspace{0.2cm}

The final inferred assertion is a formula that actually contains many different configuration values.
This means that there may exist multiple decoders for this inferred assertion.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{fdtest}
\caption{The SAT instance that discovers decoders}
\label{fig_fdtest}
\end{figure}

Thus,
our job here is to find out the set of all decoders' Boolean relations $\{\mathbb{R}_1,\dots,\mathbb{R}_n\}$ step by step.
Assume that we have already discovered a set of decoders' Boolean relations $\{\mathbb{R}_1,\dots,\mathbb{R}_{m}\}$.
To test whether it contains $\{\mathbb{R}_1,\dots,\mathbb{R}_n\}$,
that is,
whether all decoders have already been discovered,
we construct the following SAT instance shown in Fig. \ref{fig_fdtest} based on functional dependency\cite{funcdep}.

To simplify presentation,
we denote $i_n$ as $Y$,
and $<o_{n+d-l},\dots,o_{n+d-1}>$ as $X$.
$R(X,Y)$ is the Boolean relation shown in Figure \ref{t1} that succeeds in checking $PC$.

If this SAT instance is unsatisfiable,
then all decoders' have been discovered.
Otherwise,
we can discover a new decoder's Boolean relation by assigning the satisfiy assignment of $c$ to $R$.

A new round of functional dependency test will be perform again until no more decoder can be discovered.
After that these Boolean relations will be used to characterize their corresponding decoders' Boolean functions.

\vspace{0.2cm}
\leftline{\textbf{Inferring precondition formulas}}
\vspace{0.2cm}

Assume $\{\mathbb{R}_1,\dots,\mathbb{R}_{m}\}$ is the set of all decoders' Boolean relations discovered in last step,
and $\{IA_1,\dots,IA_{m}\}$ is their corresponding set of configuration letters.
To help the user determine which $\mathbb{R}_i$ in $\{\mathbb{R}_1,\dots,\mathbb{R}_{m}\}$ is the correct decoder,
we need to characterize each $IA_i$ in $\{IA_1,\dots,IA_{m}\}$.

Assume $Y$ and all $Y_i$ in Figure. \ref{fig_fdtest} are vectors of the same length $v$,
and the $j$-th bit if them are respectively $Y^{j}$ and all $Y_i^{j}$.
Then the SAT instance shown in Fig. \ref{fig_fdtest_simple} will generate the set of formula $\{IA_1^{j},\dots,IA_{m}^{j}\}$,
which represents the precondtion formulas for the $j$-th bit of $IA_i$ in $\{IA_1,\dots,IA_{m}\}$.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{fdtest_simple}
\caption{The SAT instance that infers precondtion formulas}
\label{fig_fdtest_simple}
\end{figure}

Thus,
$IA_i$ can be defined as $\bigwedge _{j=0}^{v-1} IA^j_i$.

\section{Experimental results}\label{sec_exp}
We have implemented our algorithm with the OCaml language,
and solved the generated SAT instances with the Minisat solver\cite{EXTSAT}.
The benchmark set includes several complex encoders from industrial projects
(e.g.,
PCI-E\cite{PCIESPEC} and Ethernet\cite{IEEE80232002}).

According to \cite{ShengYuShen:tcad11},
when given the assertion, 
no matter correct or not,
the synthesis mode can determine the existence of the decoder within 40 seconds,
and build the decoders within 10 seconds.

According to \cite{ShengYuShen:iccad11,ShengYuShen:tcad12},
the runtime overhead for inferring assertion, generating decoders and inferring their precondtion formulas are no more than 400 seconds.
Moreover,
only two out of the five benchmarks have two decoders,
while the other three have only one decoder.
This means that,
in most cases,
our algorithm generates only one decoder.
For other cases with multiple decoders,
the user need to inspect $\{IA_1,\dots,IA_{m}\}$ to select the correct decoder.

For example,
for the two decoders of the most complex XFI encoder that compliant to 10G Ethernet standard\cite{IEEE80232002},
their corresponding $IA_1$ is $RESET~\&~!TEST\_MODE$,
while $IA_2$ is $!RESET~\&~!TEST\_MODE~\&~DATA\_VALID$.
The essential difference between them is the value of $RESET$.
By inspecting the Verilog source code of XFI,
we find that the $RESET$ is used to reset the XFI encoder when it is $True$.
So the XFI encoder will work in normal mode when $RESET$ is $False$.
So the second decoder is the correct decoder.
The dynamic simulation had also confirmed its correctness.



\section{Conclusions}\label{sec_conclude}
Experimental results show that
this tool can always inferring correct assertions and generate decoder circuits for several complex encoders,
including PCI-E and Ethernet.
And the human effort in specifying assertion and selecting the correct decoder can be significantly reduced.
